drinks Hurry up Emilian we have a submission rolling_on_the_floor_laughing I thought weekend has started for some people You want to join me here Welcome please Hahahahah send tfare my weekends ended when the training started No weekend here congrate congrats for all of you And for you too                     Blog written by  Wang on Mar   described causal inference by taking the following examples Every year  million premature babies die In other words  of all premature babies die _every single year_ Millions of parents have to struggle through the grief suffering and pain of losing their child over a process they cant control Thats a problem Lets say we want to figure out whether comprehensive treatment after the birth of a premature baby will affect its chances for survival In order to solve this problem we need to use causal inference  Study conducted by Jennifer Hill Elizabeth A Stuart in  defines Causal inference as an intellectual discipline that considers the assumptions study designs and estimation strategies that allow researchers to draw causal conclusions based on data                  remember these questions Yes I do  I still face it but this time with more backup plans joyand i some how found a pattern  Im sticking with the trips that have delivery request associated with them cos there i can only do that much with the trips dataset other than find the time it takes to complete the trip and where orders are coming from is all accepted trip delivered or fullfilled is all accepted trip delivered or fullfilled does rejected trip has a relation with fulfillment and unfulfillment of the trip as per my understanding if it is accepted status it is fulfillment of the request and if it is rejected it is unfulfillment of the request so finally we can measure the fulfillment based on the driver actions later in the casual graph and model thanks Isnt it more fun to work with real data than with Titanic data Of course it is which method of iterating through pandas dataframe is less time consuming please trying to calculate distance but it is taking forever from geopy import distance\\n\\nstart_coordinates  df_tripTrip

end_coordinates in the datatable we do not have the time at which the order was created right how are we going to extract the day and hour  we can extract it from the trip_start_time but that is not going to represent the time at the order created because the trip my happen days after the order What do you guys suggest If we can assure all the orders are not scheduled trip_start_time would be closer to the created one Just an update on the data from Gokada CEO Olutosin\\n\\na\\nnbcsv contains k orders created in the span of  months from July   December \\ndriver_locations_during_requestcsv contains driver order requests and the location of the driver during the request for each order in the nbcsv Trip ID Since this is a very data intensive task we calculated it only for one month\\ndriver_locations_during_requestcsvorder_id  nbcsvtrip_id\\n\\n\\nb\\nWe can easily stipulate for now based on the orders created_at to get a sense of when the drivers got the order for this analysis if we need precise timestamps we will need to recalculate the datasets for the first month again channel Yabebal just joined the session after we ended it and is holding an open floor for discussion on the challenge Join back in if you have questions youd like answered Will it be recorded Power is out herepray Thanks for the update UUPVQ UUGQV unfortunately the session has not been recorded here I was not online on slack and for som of us who did not attend the Yabebals talk today can someone please at least try to summarize the main things he covered sorry to hear that UUJGPC hope its get better Thank you Nat I kinda know where the problem is now I was trying to find the driving distance which required sending an http request to OSRM which is why its taking such a long

us work in a group to assist each other with the project\\nWe can use a common docs to compile the report like we did last week I think that really helps with the reports here we can use the below Google doc link to compile our report\\n

possible\\nGood night then If more trainees showed up we will schedule the time welcome man  here we werent able to create the instances with GPU access We will try to make it ready till midnight or tomorrow morning UUKLBR sure we will be going through the materials till then I guess UVVGQG I suggest we have a meeting  hour before standup if every body can make it I agree UUURA if the rest of the team agree UUGZJP what do you say UVVGQG and UUURA  hr before the stand up  works for me so most probably we will get a feedback from the rest of the members til tomorrow morning until then everyone try to go through the document and select the part that you would like to work on I will also be sharing a google doc so we will write a summary of the reviewed materials in there\\nhave a Good Night everyone UVVGQG Understood your plane Have a great night too Thanks                                    Demo Realtime Image Segmentation Using PyTorch    Hiwave Hello UVNLSU Hello Welcome Hi all has anyone managed to access the instance From my side I didnt manage it I think the instance is not available now Oh okay thanks Bire are we working with one repo I think it is good if we use  organizational repo so we can contribute with our respective branch yes gtEach persons code contributions must be demonstrated as branches or commits mailtomaggycheppygmailcommaggycheppygmailcom  heres m email when you set it up I also cant from my side We cant access the data until we connect to the instance right HI UUKLBR is the instance ready We cant access it yet Yeah i think so Sorry UVNLSU I asked him before and he responds We are forming a group for instance access and will update you guys here we werent able to create the instances with GPU access We will try to make it ready till midnight or tomorrow morning Hello everyone Ive set up a repo for us to work on with a main branch protection rule We can add a commit to our branch and make a pull request before we can merge directly to the main branch As a result at least one team member must approve the branch merging in order to avoid merge conflicts Dont forget to accept the invitation too\\nThis is our repo  Hi everyone Have you gone through the challenge document I tried to skim it But we can see that togather tonight So at what time shall we meet are we working on groubs  Yes that is great Almost any time is ok for me Lets wait for the others hello groups is this a group challenge or an individual consider me when you schedule for meeting this night I have oneonone session at  UTC   UTC i think it seems group  but report is individual UUGHTV So what did we decide  here we werent able to create the instances with GPU access We will try to make it ready till midnight or tomorrow morning Okay Yididya Thank you very much for the info Check your email and accept the invitation Thank you for preparing the github organization Look at the tasks I created on the github project and give me a feedback to add more tasks or to remove some tasks For our  tomorrow meeting we all should come up with the design of the project We all should release the design diagram on this channel before we start the meeting What do you mean by design diagram The overall design of the project in one diagram We can put the components of the project Where we start How the pipeline goes the end result Components of the project can include the dataset  the machine learning model the EDA development tools and any other thing So like a flow diagram Yes In my understanding in this project the main and the difficult part is the image segmentation I think we should give our full focus on that It the part that is new to us so I agree we should try to understand it So for tomorrows meeting we should bring a solution for the following problems\\n Finding a good method of image segmentation\\n What is our expectation from the segmentation output\\n How can we feed the segmented image and the performance data to the machine learning model\\n What is our expectation from the model output I hope by tomorrow we will have an access to the dataset \\n\\nAI art looks way too European Good morning Champs Welcome to week  of Academy intensive training Congratulations for making it this far The light in the tunnel is getting brighter  In a week we will eventually see the light at the end

image that belong to the same class Semantic Segmentation models make predictions for each pixel and return the probabilities of the classes for each pixel These models are evaluated on Mean Intersection Over Union Mean IoU\\n\\nInstance Segmentation\\nInstance Segmentation is the variant of Image Segmentation where every distinct object is segmented instead of one segment per class\\n\\nPanoptic Segmentation\\nPanoptic Segmentation is the Image Segmentation task that segments the image both by instance and by class assigning each pixel a different instance of the class  We

       "WEEK  SCHEDULE\\nchannel Kindly find week  schedule in the link below\\n\\n    A real life company implementing this weeks challenge   Every one \\nMe when I was looking for some solution to my error and find it after one day    They are investing heavily into the metaverse their market cap might go down in the shortterm but theyre positioning themselves for the future the market isnt as optimistic Im not too concerned about the market it tends to be more cautious and favors the status quo but tech companies need to be disruptive and forward thinking I dont understand what you mean the market wants to make money and while there are cautious people in the markets there are also a lot of clever people investing one cannot just discount the market signal I think for example is Meta able to respond well to TikTokstyle apps Wallstreet wants a tried and true formula to invest in like Metas ad business but if Meta can demonstrate that the  metaverse is the future and that it can be profitable then the market will change its tune And if there is one thing Meta does well is copy features of its  competitors and come out on top so I think they can beat TikTok maybe but I think you are underestimating the sophistication of the global markets I dont think we can put too much stock into the markets Wisdom after the  market crash a predictable and avoidable disaster I think that we should avoid these generalizations like the market is dumb or people are cautious  there may be examples where that is true but its too much of a generalization to be useful The subprime financial crisis was emblematic of industry wide callousness and ignorance people working in finance either knew about the potential downsides and didnt care or they were completely ignorant Therfore I dont think its a hasty generalization thats my opinion anyways I think you changed the topic I thought we were talking about Metas valuation Yeah my point is we cant always say the market knows best because of the reasons I mentioned above And we shouldnt judge Metas future based on market indicators OK good luck You disagree I said my points above  I believe the market provides a useful signal of future value  It is not always  correct but I think its not wise to completely discount it We live in the world with its systems  I think that as you go into the world the idea that so and so is wrongcorruptirrelevant becomes less useful One must usually work with the world and manage its imperfections But then things will always remain the same I think going against the grain and the status quo is the only way to improve the world Being some what of an idealist is important Were talking about predicting Metas stock price here I dont think were actually talking about improving the world But more in general  going against the grain rarely means jumping off the board of wood and working alone To your point Metas focus on the metaverse might seem unwise right now and might lead to lower valuation but it is going to pan out To quote Metas own motto Move Fast and Break Things But you present no real evidence for your statement There is clear evidence that the metaverse is the future it shows year over year growth and the rate of adoption of VR and AR will accelerate as devices become more capable and affordable Meta will be in the best position to take advantage of that because of their first movers advantage \\n\\n\\n\\n Maybe this can be the topic of the next debate are the sources you are presenting good sources This statement the metaverse is the future is not proven by any means Meta will be in the best position to take advantage of that because of their first movers advantage\\n\\nYahoo was into search before Google  Google was into social networks before Facebook  Facebook was into videos before TikTok  Can we really say that first mover advantage is determinant Yes they certainly are good sources and the theme across all of them is the same the metaverse will be the next big tech platform And first movers advantage is often times beneficial and Meta is acquiring almost every competent metaverse startup so theyre already cornering the market Here is another source to corroborate my point about the metaverse being the future \\n\\n gt _NB NOT A MOTIVATIONAL VIDEO THIS IS WISDOM IN ONE MINUTE_\\ngt _ALSO NOT A CLICKBAIT_\\n Wait why is this true Yes they certainly are good sources I feel like you are accumulating maybes and oftens to make a point which isnt borne out as strongly as the data shows But sure perhaps  Im personally not convinced either way but I find the strength of your arguments to be somewhat lacking Did you read the Bloomberg article content  Does it mention that Facebook is poised to seize the opportunity The Bloomberg article is an overview of the metaverse landscape mostly about gaming At this point its a matter of personal opinion to believe whether or not the metaverse is the future but we will see who ends up being right in the coming years Of course we dont know Noone\\nDJ Khalid Another one Welcome everyone would love if everyone has a quick presentationsummary of week  that can be showcased in this Mondays

have access to this weeks challenge document in Tenx you can use it to discuss and get feedback on specific sections I think so it will be addressed Thank you This is the total cost UUJGPC which includes both the  and  on the payit forward UUGYHAUT not the amount but the Batch UUFVHFNF okay it has been fixed now This asks for permission UUGJPC UUEJR  How about now You should be accessing the form It works now channel if you havent joined the standup please do so  Could someone help me in generating the ssh key  Thanks UUGJPC if you already have git with bash installed on your windows machine I think the easiest way to generate and use SSH key would be\\n Generate a key locally\\n sshkeygen t rsa b  C ltemailaddressgt\\nt type of encryption b  strength of encryption\\n list the generated key\\nls  grep ltkeynamegt\\n copy your public key\\ncat ltkeynamepubgt Join us for the intro to the week challenge  To SSH into any remote machine you can use\\n  start the sshagent in the background \\n eval sshadd s gt\\noutput  Agent pid \\n add your SSH private key to the sshagent\\n  sshadd ltpathToYourprivatekeyfilegtltyourPrivatekeynamegt UUDRQH and UUURA\\nI am not sure if that is how we should download thembut you can download the data by selecting dronedate and time\\nI tagged you guys because you were asking on Gmeet Anyone finding it difficult to open the service portal help me out Thanks bro Great In the tenx platform in the git performance I am in the below  on most of the fields  Can anyone tell me the best practices to improve those numbers Guys today we havent class No tutorial today UUHBCXDY\\n youre welcome airflow db reset\\nthis solved the above error however I still could not start the airflow webserver I tried both admin admin and airflow airflow  I dont think there is one rather u set it urself  how airflow users  create role Admin username admin email admin firstname admin lastname admin password admin UUFNPEUX  right skintone what if role admin already exists  i dont know about thatothers might help us here ok I did not know why and when the user admin was created but I solved this by creating a new user and give it a password and name and all and used this new user to log in to airflow webserver UUFNPEUX UUJGPC thank you both I have question do we consider dockerized projects as a cross platform application or projects  like application written in flutter  I am not sure how to respond to this question but I think the whole point of dockerization is so that we could run them in any environment This is easier  thank you I will share it in the resources channel I think that will add the downloaded data to postgres right Because dbt will need to access it\\n\\nWill we create then a well structured database with the data This means creating tables right\\n\\nIm thinking about how to put the data in postgres\\n\\nSome clarifications and hint will help Thanks I circumvented this by creating another user with an admin role I also am in need of a good postgres connection with airflow tutorial MySQL is not working for me The problem is I cant create any user It always fails with this same error did you try airflow user list what does it say For this task we are supposed to use PostgreSQL thank you brother No data found Check out this guide  really has that been explicitly instructed UUURA Yes in the challenge intro I did not get that error I first run\\nairflow webserver\\nthat did not work so I reset my airflow db by using the\\nairflow reset db\\ncommand followed by\\nairflow standalone then the admin user with the Admin role was already created but I could not know the password that was where I created a new user with a new password and used it to login Yeah what I have done was airflow db init and then create user you used standalone which runs airflow db init airflow create airflow webserver all at once I think that was why you had the password issue previously there goes hrs I will never get back all because not reading the challenge doc\\nMaybe it would even have been simpler to user Postgres to begin with\\nanyways thank you UUURA  IMPORTANT\\nHi all please generate ssh key and copy your public key with your basic information in the following form \\n\\nWe will use this ssh public keys to give you ssh access to a cloud instance

       "the value of the analytic average score are all less than  UUURA Yes you are right all are even below  for this sample size but in the task and also in the intro to the task it is stated that the range is   any help to extract data from json file  Import pandas as pd\\ndfpdread_jsonyourfilejson does this will make data ready to be send to cohere  no you need further processing Hi channel\\nTrust we are going good \\nA good number of people did not hit the nail in respect to the developing curiosity exercise Hence in the coming weeks we are going to have a how to ask questions session  most likely a redo of this exercise Please do go through this  list for better insight\\n\\nWe are going to have a Mock Interview next week  UUJNYC UUVHCVKB UUDBCX UUJGPC please prepare your

       "Sorry for the delay it has been uploaded now to the GDrive Thanks Standup is starting in few minutes Lets join THE LINK TO OUR hackerrank CHALLENGE  Thanks Nahom channel we are kicking off the guest talk   Please join  trainees are yet to join If you are among these please join or send me a private DM of why you are unable to join guys I need your help\\nwhile i addin the file to the gdrive it says every thing is updated but nothing added to remote Is your default remote correctly set ssure UUHBCXDY try it by changing the conda envt The excel file has not been updated We can not then fine tune what conda yea sometimes the Anacondaconda virtual environment is stacked with dvc maybe if the problem occurs with that create a new virtual environment and try with that Having the same issue here I even tried to lematize the content UUURA How did you do UUH Am having the same issue here Even after lematizing it I am not able to get pass this issue Yeah The text are too long You can use embed UUH I am not sure about the Body one but for description it works fine Still lack of enough samples is an issue here You can not make accurate classification since we dont have enough samples for each classes we create yeah lack of enough sample to fine tune Yes this is a great issue embed I will try that Even if u classify it with  test data and the rest train data face_exhaling Its still not accurate because the two test data can only have the score  they cant have an other value since we dont have enough samples example we only have one value with  so even we label this and try to put it in the test set it will complain saying that specific label is new which means we have missed it in the training dataset Yeah thats actually a great problem I thought about tampering with the data but still dont see it as a perfect solution Yeah but anyway there are a lot of zero and only   There is no thing to classify and from  to  Its not interesting If you can come up with your own data like collect from the internet some news and give it a score based on intuition I think its the only way to proceed at least  rows Still not enough but it is better than what we have right now how can I access my api app and see each endpoint and see if it is working and what Ive done You can use postman or for vscode you can use RapidAPI its and extension How does it work Could you brief me  Thanks this video has a brief walk through Thank you If you hard time using post man you can use Rapid API Let me send you a resource on that  I need your help in preparing data for bot excel and text file What I suppose to do to make my data ready to send via api Could you elaborate more I already imported my excel file and I dont know what to do in the data to be ready to send as prompt in the api in terms of job description what should I do to make data ready  In terms of the news I guess using classify is more efficient than embed but since we have very limited sample and since classify has an example input limit you have to use embed but before proceeding to that I suggest you try to truncate the description and body with out loosing the context then try to group the data based on their analytic scores so like give a class for each score so for example you do first classify below  and above  then based on that class you do an other classification for the bottom and top classes since we have very limited data just try to classify it in a way that fits your approach then split your data and do the classificationembedding For the job description part try to come up in a way to send the content of the json as a prompt for example you can concat all the texts inside token which have the same entitylabel just make sure at the end you make it dynamic thank you UUURAI will try todo sothank yo very much I didnt see any suggestion as to how we can defend against prompt injection as we can in sql injection Youre welcome  DAILY STANDUP REMINDERtimer_clock

musicslightly_smiling_face  UUGQV      Nice for prompt engineering \\n  It might be helpful\\n      Hey channel when youre done with the challenges please join here  to share various approaches everyone has used to solve the challenge  UUKLBR UUH why do we want to use HAVING instead of WHERE I just had a good look to the question and it was just a filtering problem right  we shall use HAVING only in grouping i think There is nothing to group here so why is it necessary to use having If we have a way to sum the result set we can do having I second you We use having clause if you need grouping and they dint specify if we will group anything Or I didnt understand it well Yes UUJGPC the population is already given and we dont even need an aggregation function That would definitely be something to look at UUURA We can try to use a sub query to sum up the results Sure then we all agree that we can only use a WHERE clause UUKLBR\\nI have managed to use subquery and count all the rows returned from group by but the out put of  having query was wrong it was supposed to be  but it is \\n\\nSELECT COUNT FROM select count from CITY \\ngroup by district\\nhaving sumPOPULATIONgt  as A This should work Not sure why you are using district tho Can you try name SELECT COUNT FROM select count from CITY \\ngroup by name\\nhaving sumPOPULATIONgt  as A Yes you were right name works having clause with district doesnt work because we are checking sum of populations of the districts not cities which means if we have  cities having population greater than  with the same district if we group the sumpopulation will treat them as  not  Nice this is implementing the solution in different ways and helps us to understand how to use the different available clause having clause here We need to look at the efficiency and simplicity of  the query we are going to use tho Flawlessraised_hands
