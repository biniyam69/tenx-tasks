 Can we have the last session recording please Hey guys is there a link to week  Google drive yet   Thanks man Hi guys UTEPYRMP should we submit our GitHub repo today and start working on that or are we supposed to performcomplete the tasks before submitting the link There are only two submissions this week On Wednesday and Saturday
Kindly refer to the challenge document on this alright thanks It will be uploaded very soon Thanks It takes more than two minutes for my excel file to load into a dataframe any idea how to speed this up why not you use the csv and mount on drive colab Use csv file There is a csv version of the provided data  where is that  Thank you Thank you yeah  UTEPYRMP When can we expect to have the video recording i think its released on youtube any link  All todays videos are available there Thank you  this is very helpful article I got this error in Travis ci We are unable to start your build at this time You exceeded the number of users allowed for your plan Please review your plan details and follow the steps to resolution Anyone who has experienced this error love to  work on new errors can you post a screenshot I will try my best That was the error on my travis account But now I have talked with the Travis guys and they assigned me a trial plan ok I understand this to be a task where we aggregate the  things listed in bullets based on each users or per users My question however is which feature are we supposed to use as users for the four bullets I think we can use
 number of xDR sessions  Bearer Id
 Session duration  Dur ms or Dur s
 the total download DL and upload UL data  Total DL Bytes and Total UL Bytes
 the total data volume in Bytes during this session for each application  aggregate for all the applications provided 
 Which feature did you use to make the aggregations per user Task  Yes Now how to identify the users  Im looking for it since which feature is user  A user can have unique mobile number or phone I used IMEI to identify the used but you may use MSISDNNumber or IMSI UUVHCVKB you did the right way UUKLBR I have used sum but it didnt sum the values I want to add the duration with the same id in the first column I didnt add UUVHCVKB Is the number of xDR session Bearer Id
I thought it will be the numbers of session per user I mean the number of of Bearer Id for each user a value count Which feature did you use to make the aggregations per user Task ",0.0035404258,0.33491167,0.66154784

    here All questions related to the weekly challenge should be in the channel for the respective week  Please ask UVAMTFA if you have any questions  Thanks Hello everyone how are you doing
I got a problem anybody who can help me please
I want to follow the git workflow however my git repo has not a fork icon how can I gate it UUGBTMY Please ask in CTEQQSNFallweek Have you got any help nop UVAMTFA UTEPYRMP Isnt there any submission today I was expecting task  as todays submission Is that not dont think so we have two submissions this week technical one on Wednesday the interim and one on Saturday the final Carrer one on Friday and other one on Saturday Kindly ask in CTEQMHHallideas check your direct message UUGBTMY also follow up the question you asked in allweek UUGBTMY UUUMMYH Seriously That means that yourre really far well said UUH well said Im still on task  and UUUMMYH did you competed task  already did not see it that way earlier when I replied to the message UUVHCVKB  I take my hat off to him First you need to group by IMEI number then apply aggregate function on the desired column 
aggcol_nameoperation
U can use sum as operation here Does the ltnumber of xDR sessionsgt task   refers to ltTotal Duration of the xDRgt Isnt that the count of the the XDR sessions should I count bearer id per IMEI Yes UUJGRNE You will count the number of sessions by the field that uniquely identifies each user UUKLBR How can I count it  Can someone help me with the aggregation Im not having good idea about how to do it  Check this site It mighy help
 UUKLBR and UUKGSDGSG Thanks a lot Important site for working with missing data in pandas  Im thinking that the task will use the data made in task Right For the total data in bytes for each application do you think that its good to some the DL and Ul for each application What does this mean please Milliseconds offset of start time for the xDR I think is about the shifting from the start time I think that is the millisecond after the end time The total time is Endtime   someoffset  start Time I believe you can do that
You might just need to upload the dataset to your google drive UUH  yeah you are right it is Bearer Id You aggregate it bearer id per user UUH you can use the sum function on the series you grouped by the user Hey UUJNYC like Birhanu said using the  file should be faster If that is still taking time look into moving your workflow into  Colab UUVHCVKB Thanks Which feature did you use to make the aggregations per user Task  just to be sure Hey UUGJPC it looks like youre gonna go on to have similar issues when your trial period ends Travis is of course alright but maybe start looking into  Actions Some of the tasks in the coming weeks will require the use of it and it offers a very generous build runtime for your workflows i used ltMSISDNNumbergt because I think it represents each user uniquely there may be multiple ltbeare id gtper ltMSISDNNumbergt I also thought that is the user feature but Im not sure Thank you very much UVLHPDME I used that one too Please do we have to replace the ouliers I think that if we replace them we will change the data since they are not missing values What do you think why replace when u can either normalize it or scale it

like simple min max scaler or log transformation will do UUGHTV Thanks dear We shouldnt You can note them in the report but removing them will alt your findings You might use log transformation also Yes UUJNYC Thanks UUGZJP Thanks Hey UUVHCVKB aggregating the data is any process where you summarize it So for the identification of users you can use the IMEI as Yasabneh specified which is given to every mobile phone by service providers to uniquely identify devices or you can also use the MSISDNNumber which is used to identify the unique subscription on the ISP or IMSI as well You can use multiple approaches to reach your conclusion of whether or not to buy or avoid the company which is the core business need at hand The four bullet points specified are correct with the field descriptions you specified any of the three unique identifiers on the data can be used It will depend on whether or not you want to base your analysis on the apparatus  IMEI in that case or on the subscription to the ISP IMSI number identifier You can also use  MSISDNNumber which is the phone number you call All  are used to identify users in some unique way Thank you UVLHPDME Noted with thanks UVLHPDME If you take one row youll see that the Start time of the XDR is in yearmonthdate hourminutesecond format The milliseconds provide additional information for start and end of the XDR session Thank you guys youve been really helpful which methods you used to fill missing data Hello everyone how are you doing
I got a problem on following git workflow I cant find fork icon in my git repo I see the fork button from others git
how can I gate it in my own account Is there any one who can help me please First I calculated the skewness and found out that most of the columns are skewed I used mode for the skewed column Anyone from trainees  to assist on this If none please reach out to UUPVQ df_cleanrace  df_cleanracefillnadf_cleanracemode  like this function  UUGBTMY I think you cant fork your own repo being in the same repo if it is not hosted somewhere Forking is all about cloning hosted open source repo from within an other repo The fork button is inactive as of mine if I am within the repo I want to fork if you need to apply GitHub workflow this is helpful  here channel I appreciate if anyone can help normalizing and scaling nonnumeric data in a simplest way exactly I do use IMEI number even if the same person can have two or more mobiles It worked for me I think scaling and normalization are only applicable to numeric data not replacing but normalizing the outliers is best possible solution the transformation method depends on the type of data to be transformed UUH there are ways to normalize nonnumeric data with python code but I want not to go that details We can label the nonnumeric unique data and assign numeric index so that we can normalize with a code UUKLBR what can we do with our data normalization and scaling with object types How are we handling Bearer ID and MSISDN missing values
I have been thinking of dropping  them since they are unique ids and most them have Nan values for customer id as well I think there might be a good reason to remove them For example the outliers could be some noise data which will alter the findings if we do not remove it it is a bit confusing because Bearer ID is used as session id If we drop it means it will be difficult to drive session related insights I am confused too but I used mode method to fill with itface_with_head_bandage In my case there is a missing value in the ltMSISDNgt but not in the Bearer ID I chose not to drop it because I used the MSISDN as a customer_id mode here might mislead you I suppose UUFWPNCE How it misleads me What to do better This make sense to me because there is not lead to interpolating MSISDN nan values however they will be some bearer ids still missing  I want to show the ltgraphical univariate analysisgt for all the attributes in a single figure Anyone who could tell me how to do that UUJGRNE we might loose an information while dropping what we think of outlier  data points that deviate from the mean can be treated by normalizing or scaling  the dataset has over  unique values which means that almost all the values are unique so the most occurring value might not represent about  missing values We want to normalizestandardize our data when we are ready to feed it to our model And you would normally normalizestandardize numeric data When you are working with object types if they are categorical data you would perform some type of encoding which will convert it to numerical form and there will be no need to normalize that as it is in categorical form The first step is to perform an EDA before starting to process our data and that will give as an insight of the data detect if there are outliers and so on UUKLBR what about filling the missing values You can use interpolation mean median or mode based on the feature and data Alright Thanks anyone who have an idea on how to use  utility function from the folder scripts just i follow the format from scriptsutility import func_name it didnt work  me Do you have __init__py in your scripts folder Or you can try this import sys os
syspathappendospathabspathospathjoinscripts And then
from utility import  I also faced this issue UUURAs answer should do But is it necessary to add __init__py file UUURA That was only required on older python version before  or  If you have newer version that wont be required It is not necessary if you use syspathappendospathabspathospathjoinscripts
But if you do have __init__py github actions will complain and throw an error while the tests are running for your scripts especially if you dont use the correct statements
for example the statement import utils will be an error in github actions even though it works fine locally
so you have to use from  import utils Hello guys I think this link can help us  Thank you UUKLBR UUURA is this problem solved if not I can really help you Thanks for sharing  I would like to kindly recommend that it would really be nice to post this kind of resource in the allresource channel for everyone to get the best out of each and every channel Please do we have to clean fill missing values in Bearer Id  Since they are supposed to be unique You can drop rows without Bearer Ids Alright so guys I am struggling to fil missing values in Bearer Id column
how did you solve this problem  You can drop the rows with no bearer ids great I thought we have a tutorial now yes the tutorial has started Alright Thanks tutorial starting can you share the link  guys could u tell me which task will be submitted for tomorrow i need detail info i think that is because you are using two columns to make groupby
try it by removing the col Gaming DL Bytes from groupby parameter It is a  page interim report on the week  challenge like we did in week s here channel UVLHPDME UUKLBR I would appreciate if anyone help me know which variable or combination of variables can identify session frequency When Ive replaced the values greater than quantile  I still have some outliers on the boxplot but they are relatively more close How to treat them UUH tune for quantile ratio may be reducing the ration may remove the remainin I think that values are considered as outlier when they are greater than QIQ while Q is the third quantile and IQ  Q  Q May be I will tune the ratio to than value What to you think  what about github I think after replacement if I plot again its normal to still have outliers because the data have been changed And the boxplot is made for the new data Not that there is still outliers have you tried to replace values greater than quantile  or any value less than  UUJKJGRAQ Ive tried  But some are having more outliers than before and some are not having anyone Implementation of task  is expected from your Github submission You will be using the total session duration based on data description that was provided to get the duration UUH I have not tried myself But I think youre correct replacing outliers changes the distribution So it makes sense that more outliers pop out each time If the outliers arent affecting the total distribution of your data you can skip it but if it still affects the distribution you need to handle the remaining outliers UUKLBR So I should have a distribution with no outliers before continuing If the outliers arent on the other extreme or affecting your analysis that would be okay But if its still out of the normal range or extreme you need to handle them Thank you UUKLBR I will try it accordingly UVAMTFA UTEPYRMP Isnt there any submission today I was expecting task  as todays submission Is that not There are two submissions for this week Interim and final submission Tomorrow is the deadline for the interim submission Thank you UTEPYRMP and UUVHCVKB I got it Kindly check the deliverable subtopic in the challenge document  you will see what you need to submit You can also refer on the week  schedule to have a clear sense of the submissions deadlines for both technical or nontechnical For technical we have two submissions interim submission and Final submission  kindly check the schedule and challenge doc I appreciate your help I was taking daily submissions as a trend from week  As a result I tried to hurry up on yesterdays tasks posted on classroom That was misconception but it helped me a lot today I covered basic concepts yesterday Thank you thats good How do you handle missing values for handset manufacturer and handset type since it is non numeric data I used mode method Cant I just fill it with something else you can but you should be sure that the method fits well for your data type Oh yeah that true Thank you here Anyone who understood what Activity Duration feature is exactly What is its meaning have you considered the axis is that what you want could I have todays tutorial video  kindly check the CUJJLQallbroadcast channel The axis is there thank you I found it may be try inplaceTrue Or assign it to df  dfdrop Try df  dfdropcols_to_remove axis I think it is xDR duration excluding inactive periods Thank you guys df  Works How do you drop rows with NaN values with out dropping corresponding columns set the axis to   row wise you may change the axis to  or index Okay but i wanted to drop them along a particular feature if i did standardization all the outliers will vanish so what the purpose of plotting them  One moment my notebook will work the next moment its not working If youre using anaconda jupyter and you know the way out of this please let me know Is it import issue you are facing Not really It looks like a cache issue I have rerun every cell so its working again now UUJGPC will we do the same for each application  thanks a lot Yididya guys I am struggling in Standardization and normalization
what I should do I think on the columns of task  What do you need thsnk you UUH sometimes its the environment you are working in If you have multiple environments you must be sure wch environment has the modules you are using and so on and sometimes as you said it is a cache issue you have got to restart the whole notebook if you change something outside of that notebook that is referenced or imported by that notebook If you have any reference or import and you made changes to the references your notebook will not reflect the changes unless you restart it I think you will do it the whole data set the difference is not too much better to do it on the whole dataset plus as the team said on the first day you need to have a strategy if you are stuck on a problem and it takes too long to solve you actually need to have some strategy in place to maneuver the error otherwise you might not be able to do other tasks well do to two things  is burnout you might feel really uncomfortable continuing to do the tasks And the nd is time you might have done several easier and more manageable tasks in the time you put in fixing the error So as they said its better to put some kind of strategy I chose the columns of task  because of the objectives of the task To have an idea of the users behavior on the different applications The other columns in the whole dataset are not related to that UUGZJP sure I used this technique ok Think you are talking about pipelines But in your case you just want to do standardization and some small things I dont know You can just create some scripts like they said that you can be using That is the usefulness of scripts  UUVHCVKB Please ask this question in CTEQQSNFallweek  this question is for issues relating to platform or installations done already thanks",0.019432293,0.8865346,0.09403316

Having said that I would like to add some remarks on the appropriate languages usage Note that any jargons terms or words that sound way too far informal whether written or spoken are inappropriate during our course of training We understand that especially during the CBS it is great to make it fun but lets ensure we are using appropriate terms or words in our communications

Note that also this will be essential in your work place  meetings group chats etc Keep having a great week REMINDERtimer_clock  UUPVQ UUDBREG Todays standup  will start in min Join the meeting with the link below
point_right  Be reminded that we will have a hotseat session too so be ready with your questions to ask the Hotseater channel I want to clear these  items in thread that we do evaluate in addition to your performances on assignments
 Attending the standup  if you are not able to join please communicate to us ahead of time We expect everyone to attend the standup Additionally attending the standup is one thing but contributing voluntarily makes more impact  Missing submissions  It will be a proof that you will unlikely be jobready after the training or during the jobsearch phase So there is so many negative effects with this Note that we do evaluate your performances weekly overall   Attending tutorials both technical and nontechnical  Very important to be on the same page with others   Your slack engagement  very essential in supporting others and learning from others When meeting any challenges regarding the above items  your contact person is UTEPYRMP  please reach out to him or send an email to mailtotrainacademyorgtrainacademyorg with clear reasons TUTORIAL REMINDERtimer_clock  here UTEPYRMP UUKLBR UUPVQ

Curious to hear thoughts on this technology I use vscode extension for notebook and it works great Maybe you should try that you have to fetch and merge first if you are sure you wont find merge conflict you can use git pull command but if you are unsure please use git fetch then git merge Try git pull first how do I combine handset type and handset manufacturer to identify the top  handsets per top  handset manufacturer You can select first a subset of the top  manufacturer and then find the top handsets did u try to pull the remote repo first  thank you UUH tnx i fixed it tnx i fixed it Hello how do I perform correlation analysis and dimensionality reduction we are asked to calculate correlation  for the social media google email youtube netflix gaming and other
you can calculate corr

 Thank you UUJGRNE and UUH Daily standup is ongoing This also my be useful for pca
 Thank YouUUEJR  and UUJNYC PCA works only for numerical values So make sure to select the numeric columns before calculating the PCA
numeric_df  dfselect_dtypesincludefloat did you solve this one If not I can help you Are we applying this on the whole dataset  I thought we will only work withe those specific columns in task  I asking that because those features are numeric   Anyone who can help me on dimensionality reduction  May be try grouping the data and then try to get a peek on that data I think it is impossible to have a boxplot for categorical data Thank you all for answering my problem is when I run the script it says that its not able to standard strings or something like that give me some time to copy the error Is it a must to have the cleaner functions in another file Would be better Not to repeat your self I think it is a best practice to do that It makes the codes reusable is this pair plot working for you guys it just take eternity to finish i waited but no plot yet
ltsnspairplotdfPair hueIMEI heightgt IMEI is a numerical variable Not a categorical one It cant be used in hue What should I use any suggestion  Using numerical variables for hue isnt best because sns will assume its a continuous value Instead based on the type of analysis you are going to make choose a categorical feature with less number of categories to be have a better plot with clear categories do I need to normalize and standardize all the columns  thank you UUH UUKLBR it is clear now Tutorial session on modeling has started Numerical features are the ones that are normally standardized or normalized And you would perform feature scaling on the features that you are going to feed to your  model based on the feature importance feature engineering  I need help 
How do i  merge  a single file from branch into main in git Add and commit only that file and merge to main Okay thank you UUDBREG or you can use the patch command I fixed the problem using interface pray but i will try the patch if the problem will happen again it is clear now guys I could not find yesterday presentation  colab link which was about EDA  am asking about the google colab link  here you go good man I am really thankful when I grouped some of the data to achieve task  I faced some problems to plot the results How I could achieve task   how we are going to present this info the fulfill the task  UUJGPC Can you elaborate on what you were trying to do I dont understand your question  use
snshistplot 
instead in which form I can submit my answers to this task  like this  Thanks it worked Just to be clear todays submission would be in ppt or pdf please submit pdf Okay thank you should I provide it like this  UTEPYRMP It says maximum of  slides so are we supposed to convert the slide to pdf if it runs with out no issues it looks okay to me I second UUURA i just submitted a ppt file UUFQKEMV I am also working on a ppt file But in the plot function add the plot kind as argument like plotkindbar ok i will try to do it If you have submitted ppt no problem However you can convert ppt file to pdf  Conduct a NonGraphical Univariate Analysis by computing dispersion parameters for each quantitative variable and provide useful interpretation 
what this mean  it took alot of time and didnt present any outputs I think it mean you have do statistical analysis such as mean range std quartiles percentiles etc for each column separately  so calculating the skew will do the job  Calculating the skew is one method of NonGraphical Univariate Analysis You might also find other methods and make your analysis rich For univariate analysiswe have to select only relevant columns right Yes I believe so Thanks is it based on the output for task  Yes yes I really got burnt out broken_heart I hope that the tutors explain more about which tasks we should do and what not to do I was working in the normalisation and standardisation for two day and not knowing that it will be explained today and I wasted a lot of time figuring things that was explained easily today in the tutorial I could use that time to do better in submitting todays task but unfortunately I didnt I hope from the tutors to explain what are our tasks just for the first two weeks so that we get familiar with the flow and the tasks 
Thank you again for you wonderful efforts and I hope you take my notes as a honest feedback in order to make it better for all of us heart Please when we talk about normalization which transformer did you use I used Normalizer but Ive go error during the transformation NaN or infinte  I used StandardScaler but Ive got error after the transformation in my model MinMaxScaler is my last choice But I would like you tell me which one you used Thanks UUVHCVKB Well Ive only be working on one environment since i download anaconda Its frustrating having to rerun all the cells all the time How can we get top  of the column if the dtype is object Do I have to change the data type What are you guys using for your work please jupyter from anaconda is giving some troubles check for the most frequent ones probably by using groupby Install jupyter separately What is the problem with that One moment it will work the next moment it wont Did you use the same environment in both times Yes I do these things happens in seconds run a cell it give a desirable result run it again you get an error UUFVTUTV is that what you use do you have a good experience with that Can you show us the screenshot of the error When I use groupby I think its just sorting them alphabetically How exactly can I find the freqency UUJNYC   yeah pip install jupyter and install other requirement modules UUJNYC use the value_counts UUAKATQ  I think you need one on one session from to help you either install it via terminal or use vs codes jupyter notebook Thank you so much guys Ill do the manual installation later for now Ive switched to google colab just to finish up my work Can the reports we submit be in ppt format ppt is not typically for written text But it says no more than  slides Was it supposed to mean pages UTACUUW I have the same question How do trees get online

 Concise text on scaling and normalization

 Little bit of detailed text on scaling and normalization
 understand the math here  this contains python implementation of PCA and code in git hub and colab   One of my favourite analogies is the one used to describe Zero Knowledge Proofs
Normally if you want to send a crypto asset say Bitcoin the network would first verify if you have the said amount of Bitcoin in the first place But for privacy conscious users of blockchain Zero Knowledge Proof provide a cryptographic proof of ownership without revealing too much information to the network
Though a zeroknowledge proof is a sophisticated method of authenticating a transaction without revealing much details about it the analogy below breaks down its most basic function

Lets say UUUMMYH is colourblind but doesnt know it Now UUKGSDGSG needs to proof to Yasabneh that theres a difference between green and red She gives Yasabneh two snooker balls one green and one red but they are otherwise identical

Yasabneh couldnt see the difference and hes pretty skeptical To verify Hermelas claim that they are indeed different in colour he device a proof system

Yasabneh holds one snooker ball in each hand and put them behind his back He either switches the balls or just leaves them be

Theres an equal chance of switching and not switching He then brings them out from his back Hermela now has to guess whether Yasabneh switched the balls or not She can know with certainty whether Yasabneh switched the balls just by looking at the colours because shes not colourblind

If she had lied and the balls were of the same colour then she only has  probability of guessing the switches correctly So one try wouldnt be enough to get Yasabneh convinced Yasabneh and Hermela then go ahead to repeat this proof multiple times

With each time Hermela gets it right the chance it was just plan luck goes away Yasabneh eventually is convinced that the balls are of different colours

The proof is zeroknowledge because Yasabneh never learns which ball is green and which one is red He just knows theyre different colours Very helpful when you try to scale features the thing is you can only scale numerical features Therefore you need to transform your categorical object string features into numbers And that is where this link would become very useful I hope you will use it

 hey guys im finding these functions really useful in slicing the original dataframe to make new columns label encoding especially iloc

  I guess it all depends on two things The distribution of the data points and the model you are feeding your data to Good morning everyone Good Morning Does it make sense to fill missing value for a columns where there is more than  missing 
What if the columns is a variable of interest No it will makes your model produce undesirable outputs I dropped columns having more than  Mee too Alright StandUp has started  Any one who makes me clarification on Careers Exercise I like the idea of the contest very much I hope that will help us for our problem solving skill Thank you UUKLBR for the presentation  Please ask your questions on CTKDGAallcareerexercises   kindly post resources in the allresources channel CTPMJKGallresources UUJHEQQL Hello everyone and dear team
We have plenty tasks that are not really easy to do and not small as well Any advice about how to successfully manage in this kind of situation will be helpful
Thanks in advance I suggest that if  the managing team made a share experience session with one of  Academy alumni to share his experience on how he manage to deliver the tasks and time management also and what we should do to make the most out of this  months I love this Idea  I think this is going to happen in due time They said there will be guest talk sessions UUGQV Any Idea when will that be  I have no idea on that UVVGQG This will be very helpful I feel you My daily routine has been in chaos cos of the workload But I think a good system will help with time Whenever we got the chance to have a session with the alumni well ask them how they go about it Starting today though Im trying to focus on one task at a time and see how that goes UUH UUJNYC Help us by writing a bit more about what challenges you face All of your tutors are  Ac alumni  ask them directly for help I think the best thing to do here is to have your own schedule Everyone has a different attitude and approach toward things And therefore the Aluminis advice might not be applicable to some and might be even bottom line impossible for others And therefore I would like to recommend to you based on my imperceptible wisdom to have your own schedule at the beginning of the week Take a look at that weeks challenge doc see what we are supposed to deliver on the deliverables section and after you understand what we need to complete and by when you then plan out the week Now I think the most important part about the schedule is following it you might not complete everything on time and you might finish some before the allotted time frame ends But for the unfinished tasks dont waste too much unscheduled time on them as they will definitely take up the other tasks time So by planning and following your schedule even if you dont complete everything you might manage to get lots done

Last but not least dont forget other areas of your life in the meantime Everyday balance is very necessary and is definitely at least for me what constitutes the good life

Good luck and Godspeed I believe that every person has it its own way to approach things while some routs will not be appropriate for some other will be And I totally believe that sharing our experience would benefit others like what you did beside having a diversified experience examples could help you creat your own route Thank you again for sharing your thoughts and I wish you all the best same here And just to make myself clear the previous message was just a thought and not in any way resistance to the message you were transmitting on how Aluminis sharing their schedule  Tutorial session about to start I appreciate you response hey I want the link of todays tutorial it will be uploaded soon I could find it in CTPMJKGallresources  What are the columns that can help me to calculate the average throughput I was thinking of using the columns with kbps as they indicate transmission rate but I am a bit confused about the others for example ltActivity Duration DL msgt I think avg bearer TP ul and dl I need some one who understood task two to ask more questions got it thank you UUVHCVKB and UUFNPEUX What about task two man I did not understand what is the deliverables how I am going to aggregate the data and how I am going to cluster it I think aggregation is performed on the UL and DL datum You simply aggregate or add them and put them in a new column For example Gaming DL  gaming UL becomes total gaming data And for the clustering you use kmeans K Ie  clusters You can refer the following for clustering  What is everybody using to measure session frequency in the data In the current dataset youre expected to track the users engagement using the following engagement metrics
 sessions frequency 
 the duration of the session 
 the sessions total traffic download and upload bytes
Task   Based on the above submit python script and slide 
 Aggregate the above metrics per customer id MSISDN and report the top  customers per engagement metric 
 Normalize each engagement metric and run a kmeans k to classify customers in three groups of engagement 
 Compute the minimum maximum average amp total non normalized metrics for each cluster Interpret your results visually with accompanying text explaining your findings
 could you elaborate more in those points  I just counted number of session per user how  when I agg the data by groupby function it doesnt give me the total num per customer id frequency  dfgroupbyMSISDNNumberagg
    Bearer Id countreset_index have you tried it like this no  I will try it  but isnt agg used only for mean and median  I think its how many times the bearer id appeared for the same msisdn number Thats the XDR session per msisdnor the unique user I considered the MSISDNNumber as a customer id but it has duplication which indicates the frequency for example if a user with id  appeared twice in the dataset it mean that it has  freq UVHMRPGQ you can also use it to calculate sum count and other functions do you have link for more depth  Duration is given in the table
Sessions total traffic can be calculated by adding total UL and total DL
Then using the three metrics youre supposed to find out top  users I dont know if this could help as it has helped me
 The general idea is to first group the data by the msisdnnumber and then sumcount the values related to a single msisdnnumber thank Degaga and if so how could I run Kmean clustering func Not enough Do that for the remaining two metrics too session freq and traffic 
Check this out Df_nor is normalized df in normalization which method did you use Minmaxscaler  Hope youre doing great guys
Consider the engagement score as the Euclidean distance between the user data point amp the less engaged cluster According to this statement when we say and the less engaged cluster  I hope that we are considering the mean value of the cluster UTACUUW UUPVQ you can encode the categorical data and boxplot   Howwwe excellent joke Thank you slightly_smiling_face",0.045713212,0.8833402,0.07094659

But biggest appreciation to every trainee in channel for your efforts  PG said and I believe it to be true that probably the best measure of future success is effort  You guys are putting it in  Keep it up and well win together       I hope this link would please you with all the needs of a first glance

 this page really helped me for doing Kmeans clustering and cluster visualization in D
 I found this link useful about PCA
  I have found this resource very helpful I recommend you to go through it

  forwarded from a colleague UUDRQH  for windows users This is by far the best docker tutorial point_down   better than UVLHPDME    I feel like its perpetuating bias but its streetwise here UVLHPDME UUKLBR I appreciate if anyone can give me an idea on label encoding Bearer Id IMEI IMSI and MSISDNNumber columns May it have a different meaning if I encode them like Handset Manufacturer and Handset Type columns  so how could I extract a dataset from the groupby function so I could preform normalization in the data  the groupby function returns you a df and you can assign it to a variable to do what you want to do join us here  for the tenx demo The tenx session has started  are we supposed to store the features on a database MySQL if yes all of the features or specific columns so how I could do normalization in this df nan channel Guidelines from tenx team on github submissions Please review them  here Weekly contest has started I have change the structure of my repo  what I need to do ti ensure that my submit is been graded Same link  UUKLBR May I submit you the code or simply submit to Hackerank Please submit directly from the platform You mean yo can see it from the platform Yes I tried to do for all features but there are features I dropped for modeling yeah  I understand we have to aggregate features depending on the required task
But finally we are expected to develop a dashboard right That is where I got the question the dashboard needs specific important features to be fetched from db I think the db should contain whole data May it make sense are you done on feature selection with fit okay  the columns are a lot but if we have to store all of them then be it
I do not  understand what second question is refereeing to You can DM me may you reshare us the screenshot I have a basic question Are we supposed to have  GitHub repos for tomorrows submission no UUJKJGRAQ just a different link on the repo UUFVHFNF I dont quite understand  Links to the same repo Can you explain what are these  links Actually you are submitting the same repo link you submitted on Wednesday can someone here explain to me what the Data analysis and coding submission is about All Jupyter files and related links isnt that already in the repository UUDBREG Yes
But the submission links on google classroom is asking for  GitHub links
 A GitHub link to your Data analysis code
 Submit a GitHub link to your Dashboard code
Are these links to the same repo Yeah you are  right I was asking yesterday but I think they want it to be easy to find and more specific Anyway lets tag UTEPYRMP here thanks man You are welcome So your project should have different directories or branches for these tasks If you have a directory or a branch for you dashboard then you submit the link to that directory and the same for the data analysis You will only be encoding features that are going to be fed to your model The above features are just a unique identifiers which wont be useful for that model that you are going to build What is the issue that you are facing UUJHEQQL  how do i use a column to sort a dataframe something like this can help you
dfsort_valuesbycolumn name ascendingFalse dfsort_valuescolumn_name ascendingFalse got it thank you So as far as were concerned we submit same links for the dashboard and the data analysis coding Is normalizing supposed to remove outliers Ive tried  normalizing methods now and i still have outliers Do I have to remove outliers before performing kclustering  If you do You will get a better clustering of your data How do I go from having just jupyter notebooks to having a dashboard You can load your model in another python file and work on dashboard from there Using streamlit you can showcase your findings there with more interactivity Can you list out the steps please Are we supposed to use avg TCP value or total TCP value for task  Average i think Thank you UUFNPEUX  UVAMTFA UTACUUW UTEPYRMP UUKLBR UVLHPDME I am sorry guys My PC is running out of Battery I should search for battery sources out somewhere noted We hope you will find an alternative very soon I will try my best some help on Model deployment tracking deploy the model and monitor your model UUKLBR you can ask this question in CTEQQSNFallweek channel okay I think the default file post size exceeded the limit Have you pushed the dataset to github no even for single minimum size file same issue When was the first time you get this error after pushing my first notebook file try git push origin main I think it is a network error and or buffer size related problem what is your current buffersie have you seen this link
  can someone here explain to me what the Data analysis and coding submission is about UUFNPEUX please ask in CTEQQSNFallweek oh okay basically its the GitHub repo link as I understand but maybe we should cd notebooks then attach link the data analysis and coding one is the main GitHub link the other one about dashboard is for the dashboard we are going to develop I think nice thanks I learnt something today I am really bad at timed contest challenges me too also i was on bad envt future will be better lets hope so we learned this from B  employers want this Also someone with a PhD in ML from Cambridge told me once that he practiced leetcode every day for  months to prepare for FAANG interviews  He said that it wasnt about being smart it was quickly recognizing which of the  different problem types the question was asking and then solving that type quickly Were jumping a gap here  Its hard  Jump together UUVHCVKB UUDFEDHB music for the WE  ",0.47900045,0.48641625,0.03458338
2022-08-27," Im hurt UUDRQH lol joy  No UVLHPDME is the best he did amazing with just short period of time and we know docker is a big topic so if anyone wants to have in depth understanding of docker networking docker compose deployment etc I recommend this video this may help you guise    Thank very much UUGJPC Im still gonna dm though see_no_evil Thank you shall we submit same link for github dashboard link and  data analysis coding UTXVNH or should we use a separate repository for the dashboard What do instructions say UUJGPC  UTEPYRMP UUPVQ running streamlit hello on cmd gives nice hands on demos as i understand from the error you dont have a column named msisdn_number Could you check it for me  I dont understand because its supposed to be there you executed this method or did you pass df to be added to the table can you confirm you passed userinformation as a table name You will submit a single Repo You can use a fit submodule for the dashboard if you want  nice I did not know that thanks thank you how I suppose to calculate Average

 group them using the user and use the agg function of a data frame and pass the way you want to use the agg function like mean sum   

 You know you are bad at something and need to improve when it takes you a day to complete it while others do it in two hours or three Im talking about myself by the way You are not alonepeople_hugging I got it thank you  It just feels you are talking about me cry Same here  Has anyone managed to run their multiapp dashboard to help me Hello can someone explain how were supposed to use Euclidean distance to get the satisfaction score Hey I could not reach my paired mentor now what should I do  Reach out to any other trainee from the list at random I think its the difference in magnitude between each data and the centroid of the cluster that data point lies during the kmean You do this for both experience and engagement and average them to get the satisfaction  Thank you Good if it makes sense But Im not so sure what do you mean by multi app okay Which features are we supposed to use to train our regression model for task  hey UULLSTG I just finished a call with UUJKJGRAQ as I should write my report does Emtinan have to write or update her report  You can go ahead with your report shell write her report as she sees fit  UULLSTG Good afternoon I already had a report for the Peer Mentor Exercise with my original mentor But I guess that I can update my report to include my meeting with UVHMRPGQ as well Sure you can include both  yes exactly could some one help me by explaining task   UUKLBR I think you are trying to acess a value that is out of the list I thing the index you use gt the length of the list UTEPYRMP Thanks UUGJPC Task  requires you to first calculate cluster engagement and experience for users and calculating their scores Then based on scores of engagement and experience you can get satisfaction score which is the average of engagement and experience score Finally you will be building a regression model to predict satisfaction score of customer based on the engagement and experience score given how I am going to calculate the cluster engagement and experience for users and calculating their scores Clustering users is an unsupervised learning and then as specified in the challenge doc you will get the score  using the euclidean distance Satisfaction  score is the average of experience score and engagement score Are we supposed to include screenshots of our dashboard to the final report UTEPYRMP UUKLBR UUDBREG  Your final report includes limited number of slides Make sure to only add relevant findings of your data as it would be a report or presentation to your employer or manager  okay thank you How do I go from having just jupyter notebooks to having a dashboard Whats is the very first step to take You can start making visualizations or loading your models and make predictions OK here goes

 Is to actually know or plan what you want to visualize or show on your dashboard Usually almost all the things I did for myself
 Next you install stream lit or your desired mode of visualizer modules like Heroku I prefer stream lit because I never really worked with Heroku
 After installing everything you then use all your prewritten scripts here for your advantage Meaning you can directly use all the methods and helper functions you have already written for your dashboard demonstration Especially all your data visualization scripts
 Then you will create a python file or files containing the streamlit module to do the dashboard At this point it all comes to using the streamlit module to make and show your dashboard You dont have to exactly show each and everything as you did in your notebook You can make many other kinds of visualization in streamlit
 Finally after you completed what you want to show using your python file or files you then can just use the official streamlit website to host your demonstrations publicly
Here are some reference links
 Getting started with streamlit

I hope this helps Try and look over the two resources They helped me alot  UUVHCVKB Thank you so much Ill surely go over them This is what ive been looking for thank you guys raised_handsskintone  worked for a second and boom I lost it It shows me the  error code I changed my browser from chrome to safari now it is working You can clear your cache next time  clear cookies I cleared the cache and it is all good now thanks",0.053502414,0.20949529,0.7370023

and then we will create a github project and linke to our repo this will help us to share tasks I see Thanks I hope we will be working on the branch you have created I mean folder_structuring you can create you won branch after you cloned to your local machine i think it will be the same as while we were working on our own repo the only difference here is that we are working on a different task and push it to the repo then we merge it to the main hence u can create your own branch So should I have to fetch your branch  I think I dont right you dont have to do that you can if you want but Okay I will create my own branch and push it then yeap have you cloned the repo on ur local machine Yes I did But I can see only the mai branch Thats why I was asking that is greatI think we are on the same page now Alright how should I name my branch so we are waiting for kibatu to be done with the git structuring we will continue after he is done What is he going to do exactly I would like to understand Folders Projects Tasks Right I think I have to structure my own branch as well Rigth That is not important you can fetch after he is done or reclone after he is done by the way You can correct me if I am on the wrong truck I havent also done this before I am just suggesting what we should do I am new with this things No problem Im going to fetch you folder_structuring to the one I have created We wil be waiting for UUGSFHGT right In the meantime I will be reading the materials Yeas go a head we will wait him UUGSFHGT how is it going kitabu Should We have video call on GMeet Yes When  I think we will need it sometimes Youre the lead just propose Im currently trying to explore the data with EDA first point of task  before continuing my reading I think its definitely important to understand by finding out insights with eda Im on it now I will be done soon and push it I hope you guys are doing great I caught a very bad flu and it is giving me hall I hope I will get better by tomorrow morning We will have our meeting  before the standup session If you all agree I will send you the link to the google meet You are doing great just go on I agree dear lead You can already visit the branch WeekWork Im doing some eda Ive already pushed a part UUJGRNE Im really sorry for your health Get well very soon cause theres a lot to do this week Will be waiting for the schedule of the meeting and the link UUKGSDGSG where are you Ohh yeah I see Group  meeting
Tuesday Aug        AM
Google Meet joining info
Video call link  Hi guys
I thought having a group chat would be good for us
what do you think
over to you our leaders UUHAGTR and UUGQV good Thanks UUFWPNCE Nice UUFWPNCE I have been missing deadlines and I am trying catching up but not missing the current ones either hahah So Im going to create a GitHub organization I will send the link here In the mean time lets all read the document throughly and meet to talk about it later today What time should we meet UUHAGTR I suggest  pm during independent work Thats after the last tutorial session for today That sound good if everyone agrees I am good with that time I like the time Actually you can check your emails for an invite to the organizationgrinning Joined thanks There is no repository there Just created the repo UUFWPNCE Do we clone or fork the repository UUHAGTR So I would fork the repo to my GitHub then clone it in VS Code so that I can work on it offline arent we meeting now Yeah Do you guys prefer Gmeet or Slack or I can share my zoom I find it doing well on a low internet connection For me I am okay with either of those zoom is fine with me too if it is possible Zoom is find by me Please do share UUFWPNCE what about UUDFEDHB do you have zoom installed Yaa great  you can join when ready Nahom and I are just here waiting for you slightly_smiling_face and Janerose is here Yonas we are waiting for you UUDFEDHB are you having issues joining the zoom we can do it on Gmeet Sorry guys for my delay i joind are you having some issue UUDFEDHB Next meetup will be on Slack  around  pmhugging_face
We will discuss the tasks in detail hello every one good evening hi yonas hey UUHAGTR should we start the meeting I think she is not online what abt UUFWPNCE is he online I am on line slightly_smiling_face so lets just start and lets see what we understood from the document andor the main reference I think we all know what AB testing is by now right Yeah
so how are going to do this
discuss questions on the documents yes of course based on the stated question on challenge paper we can list the task performed I propose we all first clean and explore the data and visualize it if possible then work on the classical and sequential AB testing sure it will the first task we should done here i tried to list the task performed according to the challenge paper  as UUGQV said EDA on the given data
 classical AB testing
 Sequential AB testing
 develop ML Model using Logistic regression
 ML Model using Decision Trees Algo
 Exploratory data analysis pipline to a new dataset which is campaign datasets we can improvised the above stated task based on ur given comment Thats great Yonas We should finish the basic EDA by tomorrow I think doing the EDA while also reading the references provided will help us answer the first task i think it would also be good if we are able to finish the EDA before tomorrows standup yes of course so how can we do EDA on the organization github Yeah that would be great However we can try though I might join you late as I am two hours behind your time zone you can just clone the repo UUDFEDHB and when you push you can create a pull request to the main First fork the repository and work locally then request a pr and UUHAGTR will review and accept the request if we done on a single filecoding there might be a lot of conflict UUFWPNCE I think they want us to fork the group repo and work on the fork to solve this we should pull and commit quickly this action might be consumed our time I am not sure that will help us working together as a group UUGQV thinking_face the fork can help us submit individually Group Work


 Trainees are advised to submit a forked repository of the group work for


evaluation instead of that of the group This will ensure a consistent user data


for the trainee UUFWPNCE if we submit individually there will be  work on similar task UUFWPNCE then we would have so many merge conflicts eg if we want implement EDA the organization repo will have  file EDA notebook well we can consult others I might be wrong for sure but what I think I heard is that we can fork for the submission but work together on an organization or one of us creates a repo and add others as collaborators yes yonas thats why we need to fork it and work offline We will ask this question tomorrow on stand up or ask on all week  so what you are suggesting is to fork and work individually UUFWPNCE that will work too we can on branches and merge pull request What do you prefer UUGQV I preferred working on branches UUGQV so for every task we should participate working on branches branches on share repo or our own forked repo UUGQV that is what i suggest but it would be nice to know how other groups are working around this issue UUFWPNCE which one do you think we should you i think working on shared branches makes sense what can if we able to divided the task then push to share repo My thought was to work on the same repo and create another branch to work on depending on each task and then make a pull request once we are ready but it doesnt seem clear for all of us now but I am okay with your approach as long as we are progressing UUFWPNCE that was my plan too it is also same as forking it and contributing to the main repo let say as example if there  tasks needs to be performed two tasks per member would be done and pushcontribute to shared repo UUDFEDHB so working on branches or forks what about a common scripts and files for reusability and implementation of SE practices it is the same steps we took when we were working on the  previous tasks we have a main then we create a branch to work on a task then PR to merge but this time janerose will review and accept or reject it yeah the scripts are a worry it would been great if Janerose was present as we can only fork the repo guys we have two options either work on similar task and resolve conflict if any or divide tasks and contribute to shared repo yeah we will decide that tomorrow but in the mean time lets try to work on the EDA is UUHAGTR has created organization repo yes it is can u share me the repo link and let us do on the EDA to minimize tomorrows task she didnt send an invite through an email okay thanks i didnt see it before So shall stop the meeting now Mr deputy leader I think on ze repo name group  is not necessary is that possible make correction the organization name has the group  name the repo name is Adcampaignperformance thats okay UUHAGTR when you see this you should give us permission to the main repo and we should work on it by creating branches it would be hard to work on  the latest repo status if we are forking and we would be forking the repo multiple times she created the repo but we dont have rights to work on it  she will hopefully give us permission that is the best way to do this project Hello everyonemega channel I hope you are well and had a restful weekendraised_hands ready for a pumped week aheadfirethis is to let you know that your careers exercise _Tools for remote work_ for this week is ready and available in your folder as we will be having the tutorial for this week tomorrow  th  at  AM UTC  AM UTC   Kindly check it out and avail yourselves as we will be looking forward to having an amazing and productive session with you guys Thanks UUGULUY Hello channel for those who were not able to complete the Becoming a peer mentor careers exercise due to the fact that your fellow partner did not avail themselves kindly pair up with anyone and complete the exercise  we are extending a grace period of up to tomorrow  AM UTC to submit Thanks Hi channel if you are unable to complete the Becoming a Peer Mentor exercise Im available for the call please do reach out here REMINDERtimer_clock  UTEPYRMP UUKLBR UTACUUW Todays standup  will start in min Join the meeting with this link point_right  Be reminded that we will have a hotseat session too so be ready with your questions to ask the Hotseater UUDBCX Standup ongoing please join now if you havent joined yet  TUTORIAL REMINDERtimer_clock  here UTEPYRMP UUUNMRX

I will come to you if I have any issue and I will help you in some parts  Sequential part is all about the implementation of this paper It is quite challenging to understand the concept in this paper I hope it is easier for UUH today I cant join the meeting for some personal case please in form me what you are talking about on the slack no problem how is task  going have you made any progress so far I read the video and I will start work on github in  hour great we will be waiting for you okay Im reading the video and I will start just after I will be cloning this right
 This will be great Ive got the idea in that paper

My worry is now about the result and the remaing question about it We will discuss yes you are correct UUH I am waiting on the Gmeet   Hey team how are you doing I call on my friends he is batch  I ask about to create a new repository and he said we should have to use one repository for  week therefore we will submit one link I think we should go with the current one Hence we should create another repo maybe the instruction has changed what we should do  we can copy all the code from the previous repo in this one Guys lets not forget to submit on time the report and the link I was about to forget that we have to submit the interim work I think that for the final submission we will be submitting the two repository That would have been very sad The challenge actually ask for creating an other repository different from the previous one And I dont think that we will be copying the previous codes to this UUJGRNE yes oo sweat_smile you are right I said that to hint that we can copyreuse the code in the previous one if required so creating another repo will not be a problem Youre actually right It wont be a problem of course UUJGRNE when we say Split data by browser and platform_os does that mean that we will have a data set for each value of the column  Or what does it means That is quite challenging I am not sure what it means But I think we will have a different version based on the value of the columns For example for the browser we may get one version for Chrome Mobile and another for Facebook which will be the same for rest values It confusing it can also mean we group by  ltbrowser platform_osgt UUH I think we should continue working on the previous repo so I have to restart what I have been doing in the previous one sweat_smile Okay I will switch to the previous repo UUJGRNE is like you have already set up cml It was for the unittest you can create a separate yml file for the cml Alright UUJGRNE when we say Split data by browser and platform_os does that mean that we will have a data set for each value of the column  Or what does it means

I need an answer to this there is no pull request UUDFEDHB i have pushed sequential testing work in the mid of night i dontt see your branch either UUDFEDHB what is the problem I couldnt also check it on github and see if you can see your work you worked on a branch right UUDFEDHB yes i did on  a branch maybe you didnt set the upstream your branch hasnt been published yet where is the sequential notebook then should i do upstream on the main branch or other branch so git push then pull request UUGQV the issue is fixed thanks
however i dont see the branch list on repo who accepted your PR i think UUHAGTR is accepted she didnt Good work but try to add some comments and explain what conclusions you got So who can have a privilege to accept the PR Me and her but i think you were not asked for approval and merged it yourself its okay as it is only a notebook but create and publish your branch first in the future as we will face conflicting works without giving me a privilege how i could merged it and how can solve for displaying the branches on the repo git push u ltreponamegt ltbranchnamegt do this after creating the branch and before working on your codes it is best done this way okay UUGQV thank you what we will do next add comments on your work better to do it using a markdown cell Okay Ill Hi guys
I hope you are progressing On my side I dont have much work
First Script work depends on what function you need to use so I cannot create a function that serves nothing unless you tell me
so if there is any other technical task left I will be glad to work on it UUFWPNCE I understand How good are you in writing test scripts for the functions in scripts folder If you are working on plots you can check function written in scripts and see if they can help you or other function defined there what functions do you want to test UUHAGTR most of the functions there are plots what about from the extract_dataframe file Okay let me look at that UUFWPNCE you should also do EDA you can create new or try to improve the existing notebooks you could also try to make the EDA notebooks into a single one Great so no one is working on that currently we did the EDA but it doesnt make sense submitting  EDA notebooks later today i was planning to merge them all into one notebook with all the features I am still compiling the notebooks will do that UUGQV UUHAGTR thats great you could do that with Egide utilizing the scripts and creating new ones when needed How is the classical AB testing so far UUGQV UUFWPNCE Ill upload what I have done so far Okay I have started working on it yesterday i had to stop and read some statistics resources I will finish before the independent challenge starts we should also discuss on the task  we can share the insights we got from the EDA  classical and sequential tests UUFWPNCE I have compiled the notebooks You can now draw plots in the notebook great UUHAGTR I am writing test code for the functions right now which branch were you working on UUHAGTR for notebooks compilation I was on my forked repository but you can use your own scripts branch The file is data_explorationipynb did you merge it on the main branch Yes it is on the main branch hello those who have privilege for accept PR accept my pull request  if that possible why do you granted the privilege to me did you create a pull request yes can i do merge pull request after creating pull request Ideally someone should review it just to make sure a team member did the coding right but when there is no conflict you can still merge yourself UUDFEDHB is that the notebook for the sequential test having to merge with out a review doesnt make sense At leaste  person is required ill review and accept the PR yes for notebook who can make review this merge pull request UUGQV said he is going to review and merge UUDFEDHB I accepted your PR Nice work i will also be finishing on the Classical test why the branches pushed from my local git didnt observable even if recent branches for sequentialtesting also didnt visible you dont see them on github You didnt publish them first and started tracking your changes UUGQV don you finsih the classical ab testing work we should be ready for writing reports I will finish before  local time I cant solve conflict on github can someone check and keep my changes Let me check on it great UUGQV amp UUHAGTR can fix it I think it is better that we all have rights to fix conflicts I dont see your PR UUFWPNCE Did you take it down I was having conflicts thats why I closed it let me create it again It is now created UUHAGTR I have reviewed the code and merged thanks Hey here i have finished my task Ive seen the work UUGQV go through them and ask me if you have any questions UUHAGTR so we are done for task  right we can fork the repo and submit Yes I think that it is ready for submission
Ill update you on task  to task  UUGQV did nice work Guys all of u did nice work we can communicate each other for the written report if we need a better clarification UUHAGTR if u can solve my problem related to branches not publish on repo Waht also i do for future UUDFEDHB Ill get back to you on that Okay thats great Dear guys our report conclusion shoud be similar because of we are writing based on simila code exexution lets share when we finish Okay  what time shoud we share and will making correction for submission I will share around pm if i finish will try to share before that Same time as yesterday Yes UUHAGTR going to start the report face_with_head_bandage UUFWPNCE we got thismuscleskintone Thanks bruv UUGQV i couldnt make pull from origin to add some code on classical testing it helps us for showing conversion rate The repo is still at the same state it was I will try to add that codeskintone Do you have a snippet clean_df  respond_dfauction_id experiment yes no

Week  discussion II
Wednesday August   am  pm
Google Meet joining info
Video call link  sorry guys i set a wrong time the meeting will be at  local UUGPU if you are available now please notify me ahun class yalen meslogn neber i think yelenma so we can discuss UUJGPC We can talk from now on Alright 
Lets join eshi ok so guys dont forget to push your codes to the remote repo
UUJGFGHJ if you faced any challenges please see the new branch i just pushed to the repo
I tried to simplify the steps UUGPU how about you every thing good by your side UUDAPP teftehal tho here whats going on guys zm alachu eko classical notebook error fix madreg alchalkum UUJGPC mn error agatemesh   UUGQV thanks nan    Sequential testing resource
 Whats the best prior to choose for the classical testing okay that what I have being doing I think you can compute them using your sample size and the BCR But if you want the common values are  for significance level  I think its all for the classic test In addition for the sequential test the common value used for the type  error is 

I dont know if Ive answered your question here someone joined the Mondays standup with these details Can be a trainee or a team member

LastName 
Email thescom

If you recognize this person is you can you send me a DM We ask everyone to always login with the email thats recorded into our systems If we dont hear from anyone owning the above details they will go unrecognized Are Standard Error of Mean and Standard deviation the same thing  Check out this article I am actually using that haha But on another article they used std and on this they used SE And calculating for both i got the same result Does that mean they are the same UUURA Yes it is equal since P is normally distributed around its mean   There is no one in the session from Group which session were group  the tutorial session were in rn Hello everyone  How are you doing Thank God I am fine Last week I was a little sick and I didnt stay with you glory to God  now I am fine and back with peace whats new you can to tell me Welcome back hope you are doing well What do you wanna know Thank God you are good UUGBTMY
We have been learning about CML I hope you will be able to watch recording and understand it Thank you all Sure I will watch it How do you choose odd_ratio to run sequential test I think Ive found How did you choose the minimum detectable effect UUPVQ

channel 

this seems helpful I just skimmed over it thank you Nantnael so do we need to do a python code to implement it  UUDBREG The link for hackerrank asks for permission UUGQV thanks now same here did it work for you Try now It works Thanks UUKLBR sorry for the incident  We are two and others did leave the program Today I was not able to attend the sessions and the deputy is somehow busy I will watch the record We are working on the challenge although we are too You are assigned to my group I sent you an email You could check your inbox Hey I am really upset from the provided resources it is good but not relevant for our tasks I have to search for  hours to find an explanation on how to solve one subtask I know it is helpful to have a strong research skills but in this situation is overwhelming it drains much of my focus and take huge time it makes the learning journey for me very harmful
I know that I will be introduced to alto of useful tools and concepts but without the appropriate sources it useless
maybe the resources are here but no guide lines to see where to read
Secondly I really appreciate the efforts of our tutors while they provide and address helpful topics it still for me no direct link between what I learnt and what I should deliver on the submit ion
I am doing a lot of effort  and I dedicated a lot of time for this course and I want to be  job ready but I think my efforts goes useless into un necessary and unwanted tasks and search for answers that are not relevant to the weeks challenge
I hope to accept my thought as a positive feedback to make the  weeks journey enjoyable and productive  Please take a look at this resource If you prefer videos there are plenty of resources on youtube also UUGNNVB I think you are exactly on the right path my friend We are all having this struggle brother I really understand and feel your frustration I just want you to know that you are not alone Keep pushing keeping the end goal in mind

The obstacle is the way Thank you for expressing your thoughts However all the weekly challenges are real time challenges that you might encounter on the job Here in Academy we train our trainees on solving problems rather than reinventing the wheels Most of the resources will only equip you with basic understanding of concepts ability to apply the concept to solve challenges is one of the skills we require you to develop Also you should not be limited to the resources provided in the challenge document  you can expand your wings just to get the job done I will urge to kindly manage your frustration and also reach out to other trainees here when you are having blockers  I know they will be eager to assist Thank you for the support UUVHCVKB  Dear UTEPYRMP  my worries about delivering the tasks and making progress rather than stuck in the same point The community is very helpful but some times the will be busy by life or solving the tasks and sometimes it good to depend on your self to solve problems 
I am really worried about burning out  I understand you concern UVHMRPGQ regardless  we all need a shoulder to lean on sometimes Youve done well by pushing hard to solve the challenge yourself However you can always use the community after exhausting all your trials  this will save you time and energy Can you specify the issue you are having in the challenge Should we create a new repoabtestmlops for tasks  or work on the repo we created for task  Its good to know some people are  tasks ahead

Anyways I think we not only dont have to change to a new repo but we also need to do it on the current one I think it is a must to do it on the current repo the second is from the original document that I downloaded as soon as the drive is shared if it has been edited that only proves my previous thought It seems like they edited it on purpose so use the current repo If youve started using two repositories merging your work from the two repos into the one with the least work would be easier The interim and final submission will be a single link so choose one and continue using that It was to ease and separate the many functionalities youll do this week You can use  repositories but if youve not yet created  please continue on the single repository thanks for the clarification when we say Split data by browser and platform_os does that mean that we will have a data set for each value of the column  Or what does it means You can do that too but the task is based up on data versioning so you create a data version for each browser and platform OS  Follow this Link UVLHPDME UUKLBR UUDBREG a little clarification on what link we are submitting for Interim please PDF file format hope Im not too late crossed_fingers You will be using the report submission link to submit the report and github submission link to submit your github repo I meant for the github link  The org Or my repo the github repo you and your group collaborated on Am I missing something here  Thought that was straight forward oh ok the org You can fork the organizational repo and submit the forked one or the organizational repo itself It wont matter as long as we can see your work Okay thanks channel Week  best submissions issue have been fixed you can check and learn more Ive file the form to fetch hackerank user info I would like to know if there is something to submit apart of filling the form Thanks for adding me",0.1984778,0.68203145,0.1194907
2022-09-01,"Some thing happen Ive lost the data pushed in my local remote dvc How can I recover just fetch your branch which is mlopswork I was struggling with a merge conflict now it is working I have been able to merge your work to the main Yeah Now UUJGRNE Im lost I can assess the versions in my machine learning code Read can not It says no such directory We have a meeting at pm UTC right  Yes we will discuss Alright I think you should configure your dvc again Group  meeting
Thursday September     pm
Google Meet joining info
Video call link  UUJGRNE you can now merge the branch mlopswork I think the versioning is good now with the good data to version I will test with the ml code Yeah so my conclusion was that the yes or no responses were not adequate handshakeskintoneskintoneYeah the sample size also was not adequate Greatgrinning What time do we meet and discuss the remaining tasks And can someone represent us on the standup I am not in a quite place here we should meet and talk about the tasks today The work to be done is alot Yeah when is a good time for you What time is best here i am available at anytime hello Hello Yonas after the last session first we should identify and list the remaining task  then after we can divided them UUFWPNCE thats fine by me if ifs okay with everyone UUDFEDHB can you list the tasks for later I am not near my pc Okay Ill list after tutorial time Thank you Hi guys
Are we meeting now or some time later I cant talk right now but we can do it on slack if thats okay Yonas is not online right now UUDFEDHB For task  we need to
 Create GitHub repository abtestmlops UUGQV 
 Set up DVC in that github repository UUHAGTR 
 Set up MLFlow in the repository UUFWPNCE  I am creating the repo Alright UUHAGTR do we have CML on this task UUGQV Ive seen the repo Yes it is the CML task that was in yesterdays tutorial who is going to create a CML UUFWPNCE Its youre task
CML helps to organize MLOps infrastructure instead of creating separate AI platforms
 UUFWPNCE check if you can create a branch on the abtestmlops branch I need to know if everyone has the correct permission I created it It works ok_hand What should i do janerose next hello guys due to light off i couldnt connecting with you could you share me what you have been discussing Hey Yonas welcome back They are doing task  Split data by browser and platform_os and version each split as a new version of the data in dvc
 For each version of the data do the following
     Split the data into  training  validation and  test sets 
     Based on the reading material provided apply machine learning to the training data Train a machine learning model using fold cross validation using the following  different algorithms
         Logistic Regression 
         Decision Trees
         XGBoost
         RandomForest
     Define the appropriate loss function  for the model using the validation data 
     Compute feature importance  whats driving the model Which parameters are important predictors for the different ML models What contributes to the goal of gaining more Yes results
     Which data features are relevant to predicting the target variable
     For each of the ML algorithms above find the best model by tuning their hyperparameters and each time adding the tried models in MLFlow
     Prepare a Dockerfile for your project so that your model can be deployed in a docker container
 i was listing the task that performing for the remaining challenge UUHAGTR is it possible to finish task  before midnight Yes it is possible to be done by midnight Unfortunately the other tasks that follow depend on task  ADCampaignclassical hypothesistesting
ADCampaigndataEDA
ADCampaignmodeling
ADCampaignSequentialHypothesisTesting
Decisiontreemodeling
logisticsRegressionmodeling and ADcampaignsplitdata
are some tasks should be implemented using notebook Yeah try ti finish as soon as possible In the mean time can you also divide the tasks for task  and beyond UUHAGTR UUHAGTR there is no task assigned to me UUDFEDHB you will have task on  DVC has to be set up first currently I am working on it
For test 
 UUDFEDHB Split data by browser and platform_os Version each split as a new version of the data in DVC For each version of the data do the following
     Split the data into  training  validation and  test sets  So wait for her to finish that task and you can begin Yonas Okay The DVC has been set upUUDFEDHB I used this videopoint_down
 Reach out to me if you need any help Okay Janerose I was watching her So can we start task  What is my task janerose Yes UUDFEDHB Start by splitting the ADsmartABdata by each browser type and by each platorm_os Each dataset you get should be saved as CSV file and then added to dvc UUGQV For each version of the data created by UUDFEDHB you will split into train and validation and test data sets I think we all have to create DVC on our local machine I am wondering if we need  to do that on different folder other than data pip install dvc yeah I did that I dont know if we should change the folder what did you do  on your side
For me I created a new folder my_data for DVC but that was a practice so we need to discuss about that and come up with a better way guys after installed and initialized dvc on my local machine where i should create remote storage can i use my google drive I think thats fine UUDFEDHB we need to come up with a common name for data folder so that the dvc api should be confused I think dvc_data okay which branch are you working on UUHAGTR I merged with main already great here is that fine create remotestorage on remote repo how is it going to help UUDFEDHB dont u understand me UUFWPNCE Guys I will be travelling tomorrow and I dont think that I will make it for the stand upsmiling_face_with_tear ooh okay UUGQV can give update I wanted to know the specific work you are going to do with the new branch UUDFEDHB you might have said it but I didnt get it
but creating that branch is okay I just wanted to learn what is going to help you UUDFEDHB give us an update What are you working on What do you mean by remote storage i have been working on spiting data  after i created different version on dvc i couldnt push to remote I am not sure about that thinking_face UUHAGTR what is the name of devstorage when u did setup dvc on the git repo UUFWPNCE or UUGQV do you know the name of devstorage UUDFEDHB do you mean where dvc files are stored the folder where yes dear UUFWPNCE I added them to a folder called dvc_data the remote storage is in tmpdvcstorage let me know if that is being helpful or we can set up a video call and try to help each other you might be facing a problem that I might face in the  future so did u push it to origin repo so how can i access dvc_data folder you will have to create a dvc_data folder mkdir dvc_data then copy your files into it after you will have to create dvc files of in that folder can we talk on huddle Not sure what that is smiley is it like a zoom platform calling on the slack ooh okay you can call then who is working on modelling which branch are you working on UUDFEDHB splitting the data based on platform_os I see but which git branch will you be pushing onto I dont want to mess with your work in case we are working on the same branch on datasplit branch sorry for my delay Ooh okay thanks I dont see no branch on github repo guys did yall not publish it yet or make it merge my pull request UUGQV okay great but i dont see the dvc datas do i have to  create the dvccsv files i dont have a clue to be honest UUFWPNCE it seems like your remote storage is called dvc_data what should i do first before i start working the dvc is already initialized right of course it initalized first but she didnt created remote storage thats   i tried to create on local machine using mkdir UUGQV dvc is initialized yeah I am creating the workflow from script folder with trainpy file we can discuss about this tomorrow if thats the way we want it to be good night guys Are the mentors actually going to attend the scheduled  minutes meeting for this weeks carrier task remote jobs tools Or is the meeting scheduling part of the task just for demonstration purposes only

UULLSTG UUGULUY Hi UUVHCVKB  no it is just for practice on how to schedule a meeting on calendly Ok so I had a question UUGULUY yes go on There is a question that says Using your Notion account create a public page for the task view and provide this link in the Slack channel

On which slack workspace and channel are we supposed to provide this link is it on this workspace  academy batch  and this channel allcareerexercise or on the slack workspace we created for this specific exercise also I could not find the calendly schedule on calendly to take a screen shot even if I used it to set up the meeting when you click on the provided calendly link it automatically directs you and prompts you to select a date I set up the meeting fine I got a time slot and scheduled the meeting Its just I could not find the schedule on calendly to take a screenshot for the slide presentation take the screenshot of what you have been able to gather there is a task that specifies to take a screenshot of the schedule A screenshot from the calendly website I used calendly to set up the meeting and it scheduled the meeting But when I go to the calendly website to take the screenshot of the schedule I could not find the scheduled meeting on calendly you are supposed to schedule using your gmail and it is suppossed to reflect on the gmail calendar not calendly  Schedule a meeting using this  link  Fill in all information and be ready to show a screenshot of the meeting slot on your Google calendar this is a highlight of the instructions given in the exercise let me know if need further clarification
 to answer your previous question about notion you are required to create a slack workspace and create new channels then invite sadiq or me then link your notion task board to the channels you created that I or Sadiq joined Hope I am not nagging you I just want to clear things up to do a good job both for my and my teammates sake no worries at all UUVHCVKB Do we need to include the screenshots of the schedules in the slide or do we need to submit them separately UUGULUY  I think they are to be included in the slide Thats gonna take  or  slides huh The limit is  slides do you think only  slides are enough for the remaining tasks I resized the images so that  can fit in one page Screenshots are enough and your submission shouldnt be more than six slides here REMINDERtimer_clock  UTEPYRMP UVLHPDME UVAMTFA Todays standup  will start in min Join the meeting with this link below

and why is it memorable Letsssssss go My memorable moment is funny Mine is hot seat Nasunglasses That was just a warm upgrinning I am now warmed up Are you  typing it down i am sure some people will have same moments Cant wait to hear from your most memorable moment My memorable moment was on primary school when I and my friends scape out of school and went to one of the near restaurants to buy food and in the entrance of the restaurant we found one of school head teachers and the most frightening person with one word he say wait me in my officejoy and we have been punished joyjoyso hard  One huge dude tried to bully me when I was in grade  and I put gum on his chair before the class begins and we became great fiends after thatgrinning Most memorable moment I scored a goal on my own team High school secondary soccer team It was during our lunchtime football match with another section It was a corner kick and I accidentally shot the ball into our own goal intending to shoot it to go out It was memorable because I was so embarrassed and got bitten a lot for it by my teammates My Bsc Graduation Date Cruel rolling_on_the_floor_laughing Already my storyhugging_face My most memorable moments in preschools would be the after lunch naps we had smiling_face_with__hearts I wish wed have those in our adult life smile Haha Thats a good wish Fastest finger joy A time in my primary school when I stole  Ethiopian Birr from my mom and bought a hand watch  The memory I still use as a guideline was the way my mom punished me She gave me extra  Birr and ordered me to buy an other hand watch of the same type For a while I took it to buy but later on I cried a lot alone and returned back the watch to the owner and bring my  birr I gave  birr to my mom She laughed at me I was confused and asked her why why she didnt punish me an other way I cried in front of her I repented and have never tried to stole from then on That was really harsh but polite punishment I take as a life principle of politely punishing someone for the misbehave Long live to our beloved nap times Why and what happened smile I bought new shoes yeezy boost and I didnt want to use a shortcut way to school which had stones and dust in it then had to walk around for extra  min to save my kicks question I was a goal keeper and I saved a ball in a bicycle kick Speechlesss face_with_monocle My memorable moment in primary schools would be I fought with my class mate families were not with me due to long distance and i feel alone  hugging_face rolling_on_the_floor_laughing i cant ask whygrinning Anything for the kick man joy and you kickedoff obviously clinking_glasses Fosho beer My most memorable moment goes to highschool primary the day when all my class celebrated my birth day hosting a birth day party in the class room which has never been done for anyone before I felt so special This is how the pull it off I was taken out of class because this girl my class mate accused me of  assaulting her which I didnt and the principal wants a word with me so when I got out they decorated prepared the cake drinks n everything so when I get back to class they shout surprise and I was on shock at that moment My memorable moment It was in primary school I was standing at door in break time and My crush kind of hugged me from behind she said she thought I was her friend ALRIGHT BUDDIESboom THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TODAY YOUR MOMENTS ARE SO AMAZING IF YOUR STILL TYPING SOMETHING PLEASE SEND IT AS WELL

Otherwise i would like to end our session now the next session is MLFlow and DVC  on the same link be there on time rolling_on_the_floor_laughing Emotional damage My most memorable moment is when i was grade th  one girl in a class suddenly kissed me and i became nervous and immediately left the class kissing_heart Im carious to know what was next what did you do Is there anyone who refused to sit with a girl in primary school rolling_on_the_floor_laughing did you report to the principal I did not do anything I panicked so i was standing there wondering what happened Was she your teachersee_no_evil yes am here Wow Unlucky you rolling_on_the_floor_laughing i mean how did it go with the principal or heshe was part of the planning team I guess its the same girl u said yesterdayrolling_on_the_floor_laughing haaha nopno_mouth The one u cried after talking to you Who used to use a red color pen to write titles and blue for the body rolling_on_the_floor_laughing meet me in Kigali Thank God Its not only me rolling_on_the_floor_laughing Definitely Merolling_on_the_floor_laughing I mean bro cmon what about using red for the body and blue for titlesgrinning Note only that I made additional green pen from green herb lol who shows his higher grade for his parent and hide for lowest one yes me do guilty If you use a red pen for the body You will get a whooping on your ass rolling_on_the_floor_laughing They used as an excuse to get me out of class but they did take me to the unit leaders office and he was part of the plan hes chill person Nah not me I used only blues my all life Did you show them the physical education and hide the physics rolling_on_the_floor_laughing UUUSMZCZ I like the way you think men but that is a lie remember I was once get caught in front of the whole class I got really bad grade and just dumped the test but one of the teachers found it came in the middle of the class calling me and saying you dropped this by reading my result to the whole class Haha This is the payback you get from the gum thing rolling_on_the_floor_laughing especially with these challengesgrinning yep            Nice presentation about mlflow
 hmm I was confused too Thank you I got it now I think for the machine learning part you should use the groups that has more sample In general yes do only what makes sense  model only when you have sufficient data definitely not those with less than  rows UUUNMRX Thanks hello everyone after I came back to the class I cant get the schedule and google meet links Please share me   Does having  in both the yes and no columns means the user does not respond to the survey Yes That means the user is neutral Yes Good morning you all I am grateful for your response and with this support I will overcome those challenges I had problems on finding resources on how to implement Classical AB testingp value and sequential  Yeah Definitely UUJNYC Alright thanks guys May b use set_title Thank you ive used legend quite a few people actually participated in the BIO questionnaire right use set_xlabel and set_ylable instead of just label UUDBREG for the assignment of  Academy HackerRank Account due today After filling the google form should we mark as done or do we need to submit something Did this two references provided in the reference section helpful for that
    Hypothesis Testing  Kaggle
 Statistical Significance in AB Testing  a Complete Guide   There were a few others in kaggle notebooks  in R Part   Kaggle that also had code and concept on pvalue etc What was missing for you What could be better It is how we organise the references or something else nice one I think we are only supposed to fill in the google form Just fill out the form We are collecting trainees username to integrate it to the tenx dashboard UUDBREG Understood Thank you hi in task  when splitting the data by browser and platform_os is this after transforming it removing rows of nonresponsive users or do we transform it _then_ split it

also are we supposed to split the raw data we were provided by browser and platform_os or can we also split aggregates of the raw data like splitting a dataset the control group and another one containing the exposed group Thanks bro You are welcome UVHMRPGQ When you are trying to understand which features are driving to the results in the ML model you are going to build you would be more interested in users that have given a response
When building the model you will need all relevant features to understand their importance for the final outcome Hello everyone The dvc api might not get you the data you require when you use

data_url  dvcapiget_url
    path  path
    repo  repo
    rev  version


So like UUURA specified on our call if youre having issues when using multiple versions on DVC specify the data_url manually as we were only using it to get the data from DVC and using it on pdread_csv So logging manually should be a quick workaround and use the log_param to output the specific versions If youre facing any issues send them here pip install dvcall or a pip install dvcgdrive ok thank you Yeah install it with either of these
 choco install dvc
 conda install c condaforge mamba  installs much faster than conda
      mamba install c condaforge dvc

pip install dvc Okay Thanks in Advance thanks guys it worked Who can explain this am confused 

Task  says split ur data by browser and os Does it mean to split our data by browser type and OS type and versioning each  or just splitting our dataset into two data frames browser and OS

UVLHPDME UUKLBR  You will be creating a separate dataset one grouped by browser and the other by platform and so on then track them separately using DVC Okay thank you UVLHPDME I did not do any reading on log param and this might have been easily solved if I just googled DVC log_param But how exactly are we supposed to use log_param to output specific versions

Also you might have explained this in todays tutorial but the lights went out and I was not there

Thanks in advance UUDRQH what is your os

NB not related to the question you asked windows  but I dev environment is wsl UUDRQH I thought I asked the question in this thread UUVHCVKB smiley I get it UUUNMRX UUGNNVB sorry for late response I was busy doing tasks and attending sessions
 firstly all of the provided documents are good but does not help very much when it comes to tasks it kind off building general intuition about a topic
 secondly what I assume it will fit my needs is   same week project doc with attached  links or key words to guide us in our searching for each task separately for example could be a figure under each task listing links and helpful key words
 Thirdly in tutorials it be very helpful if the tutors explained which functions we will be using in our week project  and linking directly where we will use the tool or the topic he is explaining right now in the project or tasks and this maybe for the first few weeks when we are trying to familiarize ourselves with flow of work and calm down the stress
I am very tankful for listening to my thought and I hope to be a good contribution to  Academy does that mean we drop platform when we grouping by browser  what functions did you use for splitting datasets  I used groupby function and it is not valid for saving as a dataset No you dont have to drop other columns We just need to version based on specified features by grouping them Have you looked at the output of the data after grouping them did DVC install successfully what do you get when you do dvc version I dont know if we are having the same type of  But I was having issues with the newer version of DVC installations When I reverted back to DVC  some of the errors I had gone away after pushing dvc data with dvc push does it mean anyone else will be able to access your dataset after pulling from GitHub the actual data is not stored on GitHub in fact when you use dvc push it automatically put the data path into gitignore file so that the data will not be pushed into the GitHub
so basically what is saved in GitHub is only the metadata of the different versions of the actual data
I hope I clarify it UVLHPDME UUVHCVKB log_params just logs a batch of parameters for the current experiment you are running

so one way to log your DVC version would be if your data is tagged with v you would create a dictionary
params  
   dvc_data_ver v

 mlflowlog_paramsparams
you can also use log_param to log a single keyvalue pair

 its like dvcapiget_url is not working How tho change the version of my data when running the code I definitely caused some confusion so to clear things up 

From a fresh setup you start off with these commands by initializing a git and a DVC repository
git init
dvc init
git commit m initial commit
You then follow on to set the DVC remote  this is the MOST crucial step and should be done first because messing with different remotes and then tracking the changes on multiple unsynchronized remotes will lead to unnecessary complications as we saw
dvc remote add d myremote gdrivefolderid
git commit m sets dvc remote
the remote URL can be in your local file system but using google drive will be really helpful for collaboration as you are working in teams Please follow this  to learn more

After this will follow the steps where you will actually track the data
dvc add path_to_data
git add path_to_datadvc
git commit m datatrack
You then tag the specific commit and then push it to your DVC remote using dvc push
git tag a v m raw data
dvc push
The final two steps are the only steps that are necessary and the steps youll iterate over and over once DVC and your DVC remote are set and you start making changes to your data So if youve changed your remote and then are trying to go back and get a tagged version of your data using dvcapiget_url that will lead to the data URL being in a previous remote If you have set multiple remotes and are sure the data is there try adding the remote argument
data_url  dvcapiget_url
    path  path
    repo  repo
    rev  version
    remote  remotename

If that doesnt solve it go through  thread and let me know if it works Maybe you took more time than allowed in copying the verification code The error happened after you got the google auth request of dvc UVHMRPGQ thank you for expressing your frustration  this is very helpful for us to grow and address limitations in the training Work simulation  means the problems and resources you are given mirrors what you would get in a real job Our desire of course is not to mirror  of that but to help you understand the facts while supporting you with active community and tutors which you wont have in the real life job We hope then through this community  tutors support plus a clearly written tasks together with a starting reference in the challenge document you would be able to get the best of both worlds  solve the problem much quickly than the time it would take you in the real job while practicing the real life scenario Our system is of course not  perfect so we can always improve In your case can you share which tasks you were trying to solve and what resources would have been a good reference What UUURA said is correct When you split the data based on a column you will make a new version of the data  each piece containing one single element  just like groupby in pandas You should treate these pieces of data groups as different versions in dvc Based on the purpose of the split will we keep dataset with a very small number of rows I mean some of the modalities appear once Im choice to keep the piece of data with a number of rows significant for the modelling What do you advice Thank you so much I noticed that too where did you take this screenshot please UUJNYC i saw it here  UVQN can you ask that in CVGFAVUNallweek channel Ok Group by browser and version it appropriately why is this group created for its for the timed contests i think The algos are in java You can take the problem and exercise in your preferred language Its is created for the Hackerrank challenge we will be having For now its going to be once a week on Fridays but in the future we will have more of those Okay Thanks Ill search further",0.17776965,0.72132194,0.10090839
2022-09-02,"UUJGRNE I think I didnot do well I watched again the video of yesterdays tutorial and I can understand that creating a new csv is not what do The file should have the same name if I want to create different versions

Now what I will do is just to rename the csv and push them one by one could you use the google drive as your remote storage this time We should work on the local storage I tired the GDrive but it has many issues to solve it did not work for me exactly it worked for me now How did you you do hello guys are we meeting The error was all related to the google drive authentication packages to make them work correctly you should install packages like pydrive gdrivefs outhclient I thought you are busy with the submission we have today if you are free we can But I dont if kibatu is free or not kibatu UUGSFHGT ERROR unexpected error  cannot import name scopes_to_string from oauthclient_helpers homejdslocallibpythonsitepackagesoauthclient_helperspy The current error message pip uninstall oauthclient
pip install oauthclient try this yes im actually trying to finish it i would like to hear from you about what you have done so far But we can have the meeting tomorrow in the morning Kibatu has contacted me and told me he is progressing on task  I have done the data version using google drive as a remote storage now I am moving to task  I will be done with the preprocessing and eda unitll UUGSFHGT finishes his work I hope he will aslo be done by this at the midnight tomorrow we will totally focus on the report writingtask  Alright when will we meet again ERROR pips dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts
gdrivefs  requires oauthclientlt but you have oauthclient  which is incompatible now you are getting the problem that was preventing it from working it is the problem with the version compatibility of the packages YES hOW CAN i SOLVE IT pip install oauthclient after that reinstall the gdrivefs ERROR pips dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts
gdrivefs  requires oauthclientlt but you have oauthclient  which is incompatible
Successfully installed oauthclient ignore this and try running your code now ERROR unexpected error  Failed to authenticate GDrive Access token refresh failed invalid_grant Token has been expired or revoked you see at least the dependency error seems gone this is another problem can you show me the line of code that is showing you this problem send me screentshoot tomorrow morning i did git push alright this is another technical problem with google security  did you tried ltgdrovefolderidgdriveltfolderidgtgt while creating the remote storage yes at that time hello guys i have completed data splitting task with maximum effort the splitting process finalized with  data version saved on dvctmpdvc_data path
I made pull request make it merge Morning did you push you push UUDFEDHB yaa i did it it needs merge how was night great but short aha I cant see your branch on GitHub can you see it from your side Hi guys it is merged But i need someone to help me understand how i can start with my work Egide can you show me via gmeet After  minutes or so sure no problem UUGQV what is merged UUGQV The pr from yonas what pr Ooh okay I need to refresh then The Pull request It merged well Check abtestmlops repo  can we meet here UUDFEDHB can you join and make me understand what you did and how to start my work  UUDFEDHB guys i couldnt push new version data to google drive I need your help Im so exhausted Sorry Yonas
Let me try it on my side and I will get back to you soon is that right okay thank you Egide I need take rest for moment sure
You deserve it UUDFEDHB  thanks we should install dvcgdrive by pip install for upload and download data from remotes yes UUDFEDHB
After do
dvc fetch dataname of the filecsv
and then
dvc pull did u created on Gdrive UUFWPNCE UUDFEDHB the error is fixed i used your notebook to extract the versions i will do the ML testing part some one configure the cml great Nahome did u store versions on gdrive Yes i did the drive is shared with yall Yes I created it on Gdrive UUGQV What does it mean when I get this message
Authentication successful
A
dataAdSmartABdatacsv file added and  file fetched
 Okay what is my next task it means dvc fetched the data from gdrive How many dvc storages are we having and which one are we going to be using UUDFEDHB you could help me in Ml testing or you could help in configuring the CML UUHAGTR your call I can do on ML testing The three of us can code the ML models there are  And then UUFWPNCE performs CML that sounds good UUHAGTR some one start the first one and will take the next which ML model shall i start UUGQV UUHAGTR Ill take XGBoost UUHAGTR help us divide the task UUGQV Random forest
UUDFEDHB Logistic Regression okay they are not related right I will wait your models so that I can finish CML and ML flow Remember its a python file that should be saved in models folder on GitHub Random forest is somehow related to XGBoost but logistic regression is not UUGQV what about decision tree Are we supposed to do decision tree too so do i wait for Janerose or its the other way around No you can still work none depends on each other UUGQV we will do it just in case Okay you can do that btw Okay does this mean we have to do them before moving on to the next tasks setting up Mlflow should done first am i right Might be MLflow will be calling models and some hyperparameters used in our models are we using your DVC setup UUGQV yes my setup is already pushed to the main Okay MLflow will be calling your functions that you will be creating for models here I moved the file trainpy for mlflow to models folder Sorry I made a mistake earlier
 MLflow is like a dashboard where you can monitor the ML pipeline store model metadata and pick the bestperforming model gt pip install mlflow
 CML is a library for automating some of the work of ML engineers eg training experiments model evaluation datasets and their additions gt File in GitHub
Both are Mlopstools among otherspoint_down
 What mistake I thought that CML and MLFlow are the same UUHAGTR after i installed mlflow it didnt work Ive not finished going through MLFlow yet Okay keep it up Good morning channel please be aware that the deadline for the week two exercise submission is today and the submission link is available on Google Classroom the invitation issue what are we use to invite you is that email or otherassignment related to slack UULLSTG can u provide me ur email for the invitation purposein slack mailtoashittuacademyorgashittuacademyorg UUJHEQQL UULLSTG UUJHEQQL  I didnt get your question  can you explain further  Hello good peoplemega channel  I trust you are well just to end the week with the TGIF note  i would like to present to you an exemplar list of careers exercises week  First of all YALL DID A FANTASTIC JOBfireraised_handsKindly  have look at the list to get a better sense of what of you were expected to do  Real World Jobs   a peer mentor UUVHCVKB thanks i was asking the email for invitation Theres a lot to learn from these from curating the content to document formatting Using your Notion account create a public page for the task view and provide this link in the Slack channel
any idea what it means You can share your notion board with a link just as the  academy shared us a notion schedule just the link Yes I think if you can get the link and make it accessible to the public Yeah I think youll find a  dots on the top right corner where u can find a publish option  Okay got it
thank you all after creating four additional Slack channels in addition to the ones that the slack automatically creates Invite me to the Slack workspace please Thank you Guys For Careers  Exercise  Tools for Remote Work what should we include in the Google Slides
what do we mean by  point_right The goal would be for this slide deck to be ready to use in a realworld work environment Are those point_down contents of the slides

GROUP BY COUNTRYContinent Thank you I used ROUND instead of FLOOR That was my mistake smiling_face_with_tear joy me too at first and then I tried  FLOOR n it worked im having the same issue Did u install it Yes I did Have you first pushed your files to your remote or local destination Could that be a dependency problem Can try to install mlflow in a separate conda environment and specify the version when installing Im using mlfow version  should I use another version when i work with local storage it works
but when i try it with remote dvc like GDrive it fails also can we use github as a remote dvcstorage It might because of package conflict Can you try to remove the current package and make a fresh install of mlflow in a new conda or venv Maybe previous version of mlflow One of the points of using dvc is to not use Github as file storage It enables one to use storage sources as a destination for datasets and it track the versions so that GitHub will only have the tracked data info not the actual data Have you set the remote for GDrive and can you list your dvc remote Ok Ill try that UVLHPDME this still happening when i try to push using this command dvc push  I am stack I cant continue oh i see I was struglling to use dvc remote add d the github repo
in addition I dont know why but im facing authentication failed error with gdriveim trying to fix it Try first
dvc fetch filecsv
and then do
dvc pull thinking_face how did you setup your gdrive as dvc remote Follow this lady it will be very clear

 ok thanks bro I was working from the local machine  path  dataAdSmartABdatacsv

version  v and I try to access data_url  dvcapiget_url

 rev version
 however it is unable to get the path and the repo UVLHPDME any idea What was the error Is it pandas error stating File not found or it is dvc exception  says FileNotFoundError Errno  No such file or directory dataAdSmartABdatacsv Pandas or dvc is the error returned from dvcget_url  ya try to remove the leading  from your path dvcapiget_url UUJHEQQL please tell us if the problem was just a  no no same error but the file is still there right i followed the exact same step but im having issues again
it says authentication successful but doesnt proceed with pushingI read there is an error with google api may i ask what version of dvc and pydrive you are using
UUKLBR any thought on this please can you make pdread_csvdataAdSmartABdatacsv Ya it is possible but here I need the dvcapi to receive the data based on the version If you can read it using pandas from the same python file then its not folder structure issue Can you send me the screenshot of the error You added it using dvc add right yeah i did versioning  and added Can you send a screenshot of your error UUJGPC I am using dvc version  try dvc pull on your cmd and see if that gives you any clue I think you need to add it first before you version maybe I dont know Im not sure says everything is up to date Your dvcstorage is it local or online storage it is local your dvc file is in the CUsersEkubayDocumentssmart_ad_ABtesting yes Can you add the v flag just to see more desc
dvc push v I am out of options brother its hard to debug form here thanks for help bro u did everything Is this the only output This is weird Are you getting this after pasting the token for GDrive auth rev is normally used when the repo  is a Git repo and specifies the tag name or git commit Can you maybe push your files to GitHub and put your repo commit to rev and give it a try it doesnt ask me to paste the token rather it automatically opens the browser  and closes after i logged in have you changed anything related to storage did you move the data containing folder to another location and tracked that instead of the first one UUVHCVKB no I didnt do that UUKLBR  I will try that UUGNNVB for the first reply I didnt do it but in the next sessions I will do it I though that it is not appropriate to ask those type of questions Secondly I always do that when I struggle with something but sometimes you need help from people who have been through this situation before also the community could be busy solving their own problems but till now I get most of the helping from my peers for your second reply absolutely in working environment no one will give you guide all the time and I believe it is essential for every one to build a way to tackle difficulties However my I suggest that this type of guiding could last for couple of weeks try uninstalling pathlib
pip uninstall pathlib

uninstall dvc and reinstall the version fish stated Is there anyone who observed what is under the date column in the data provided for task UTEPYRMP Morning here hope everyones excited about todays challenge smiley Were going to be focusing on SQL and hash tablesalso commonly referred to as hash maps here are a couple of resources to get you ready

splitting data for train test validate  Nice tutorial for AB test
        I would like to invite you this wonderful resource for this weekend
 This is a good resource on scikit learn pipeline
   are we expected to prepare a separate file for task with the existing code Can anyone explain to me what were expected to do on Task  Are we supposed to repeat the same process weve done so far We can use the commit SHA for rev to get a specific version of dvc right I think you better do it that way Its all about pipelines the third task and so you might want to refactor the main stages used like the data preparation cleaning EDA and classical and sequential hypothesis testings The preprocessing for ml and finally the ml approach to hypothesis testing to their own separate stages That might come in handy when you finally deploy your pipeline to them because now they are separated and can be run separately and consecutively Exactly repeat the same process weve done so far But and this is a big But using pipelines not manually writing everything again

We are supposed to make a pipeline that can automate the process of what we have done so far I personally did not try it but I heard you can use commit SHA to get a specific version in DVC in two or three tutorials on DVC maybe one of the things we need to do in the data cleaning stage of the pipeline is to convert these dates to their native datetime object data type format have you managed to solve or circumvent this error UUJHEQQL Forgot to add the tagssob Thanks fish Nice UUGQV the feeling you get when you fix an error right that feeling is my cocaine rolling_on_the_floor_laughing wrong channel but im addicted tootriumph not yetam trying from scratch again Thanks UUVHCVKB what are the appropriate loss function for our models and what is  the target column I choose yes column  and in loss function I apply mean squire function and all values were zero We also choose yes as the target variable and for the loss functions we choose  Mean squared error might be a good loss function for classification problem UVHMRPGQ Please have a look at list of loss function for the current problem Resource shared by UUVHCVKB is also great What is the first unnamed column in the campaign data two anyone please thank you I will do soo but I have read that MSE is goof also for regression what about that info  Is the current task a regression model You can drop that column UUFNPEUX okay Thank you You are dropping it because you are expecting similar data format to the original dataset and has no relevance for the model you are going to build understood The loss normally becomes  when you have a perfect model which is rarely the case What loss function are you using Mean square error  for the new dataset how can we convert the string object in the date column into a datetime object dfcolumns  dfcolumnsapplypdto_datetime thats not working im getting

During handling of the above exception another exception occurred

BTW dont we have meeting in google today I dont see any link I you see Please share me  UUGBTMY We use the same google meet link UUFNPEUX shared above for everything every single time Is this week going to be a group work or not I think not This week is individual work The introduction to challenge has started now  Id like more explanation on the Promo column description please

Promo is a continuing and consecutive promotion for some stores   store is not participating   store is participating This column shows if a store is running a promotion in a continues interval or consecutively While Promo shows if a store is running a promotion on that day  There could be a case that a store runs a promotion for a day but not consecutively continuously Clearer now Thank you Nardos Thanks but sadly Iwas joined the meeting with mobile My broadband network was interrupted  Hello everyone how are you have you shared week resources and challenge Im not shared that what happened   I think its not going to open unless you were invited by  Academy team Yea I send them request I dont understand why UUGBTMY sorry about that You now have access to it  Okay Thank you so much Hello
How can we treat the missing values in CompetitionOpenSinceMonth CompetitionOpenSinceYear
       PromoSinceWeek PromoSinceYear PromoInterval In your opinion what about filling forward or filling backward ffillbfill  Or use the mode But does filling them make sense How long does it take you to install dvc Im installing with conda and its taking forever For example CompetitionOpenSinceMonth CompetitionOpenSinceYear are  NaN when Promo is  Normally it should not take too long It should be like ant normal installation Create a new virtual env and try again Dont forget to install other dependencies for your project too But are the two really related Competition opening and promotion Maybe remove contentdrive After removing try to store your data in the files directory in google colab its still not working after removing contentdrive what do you mean the file directory in google colab do i have to use the directory Colab Notebooks What is pwd result I think for some Stores there are no entries under some columns at all for example for Store  PromoSinceWeek	PromoSinceYear	and PromoInterva are NaN which means you dont even have values at all for each date  I dont know it is a challenge for me also pwd result is content No sorry I wanted to say PromoSinceWeek PromoSinceYear PromoInterval exactly UUJGRNE Do cd driveMyDrive Then do ls to find ac ok nice this worked why does cd work but not cd I think that in Promo variables we dont have to fill any thing cd is an exception I think huh thanks thumbsup may be in competition but we have to find a good approach to not just fill An approach which will make sense We may consider filling per store or  I will think I have  questions could any one help me with the formula or the structure of the interim report 
my second question is how could commit my changes in colab does the save copy in Github do the job  Yes saving a copy on github does the job so what is the structure of the repo Actually it may not have an impact while modeling the ML because we should only consider the TS data If you look at the data in storecsv it contains a constant value related to each store that does not change over time I cannot say it does not impact the prediction but they are constant For instance the location may impact your sales but it is not TS We may be able to find out the impact of these attributes by EDA so filling these attributes may not be required I dont get you you just have to choose a repo to commit it to no the last comment was a different question and it mean how should my  repo look like  Yes youre write
Lets go ahead and see
Thanks UUJGRNE UUFNPEUX  thank you UUJNYC
UUGQV always ready for help ma maan fire UUJNYC it took forever for me too The issue was solved by creating a new environment and installing following the instructions on dvc website I realized that there  data file and each one of them is different from the othersexcept test and train what data file we will be working with  I think we are supposed to forecast the sales feature for the test data i didnt get you  store test and train
sample was for submission on Kaggle we train our model with train data set Then we test it with the test dataset to check if it yields predictions of sales for the period asked As per my understanding ofcourse okay then what data set we should use for EDA and cleaning and further for predicting  store or test  okay I understand you now the we just use train data set for EDA and modeling and test for evaluating our model right
then what about sore data set  You will be using store and train You will have to join the two datasets based on the common column in both datasets okay thank you that what come to my mind now its in the store data set that you find supplementary information about the stores over one thousand stores how can I deal with missing data in store data set specifically  null data in
 CompetitionOpenSinceMonth    
 CompetitionOpenSinceYear
 PromoSinceWeek
 PromoSinceYear
 PromoInterval data is dates how could I fill it I cant drop it because the data set is too small nd the missing data is  of the total dataset thank you how did you handle missing data using median for numeric values StoreType  differentiates between  different store models a b c d


a b c and d not described Is that okay Promo  Promo is a continuing and consecutive promotion for some stores   store is not participating   store is participating  The data cleaning process will involve building pipelines to detect and handle outlier and missing data

How do I build pipelines for this UUJNYC I have dropped a resource regarding your issue in the CTPMJKGallresources channel and kindly recommend you take a look at it Thank you Im checking it out now Whats the very first step of dvc Can I still use Google colab if I use dvc Todays standup was so informative we should have more of those Every Monday till week  Is brain computer interface AI UUFVTUTV No I dont think it is
  Thank you for your support I will keep asking as much as possible UVHMRPGQ keep asking questions  In our experience she that asks a lot progresses a lot UTEPYRMP when will todays sessions be posted Light was out the whole day and i couldnt attend the sessions It will be uploaded soon Ethiopian New year Loading  Tomorrow is the first day of Pagume We are in our th month of the year which has only  days Lucky us Do you now the reason of people washing their body in the morning in Pagume days I only know the rain on Pagume  is tsebelHoly water
Fun Fact Pagume  has a relation with next years Christmas both will always have the same day so for example Saturday Pagume   so Christmas will also be on Saturday December   Really I didnt know that What about when Pagumes become  days Cleansing ones soul from any sins commited the the past  months and ensuring a healthy journey throught out the coming year Yes You are right UUFVTUTV every  years or leap year the th month will have  days So the funfact that Nati mentioned work in leap year UUGJPC Yes it works let me tell you the reason UUGJPC if we have a large datasets we can check UUURA funfact It is referred as to Jesus being born which led to the New TestamentAddis Kidan from the Old TestamentBluey Kidan so every end of a year points to the day Christ will be born As a truly new year new oneself true change UUFVTUTV And every  years Pagume will have  days Another fun fact Its amazing Wow I didnt know that Amazing BTW I was arguing with people  days of Pagume and I didnt have a reference I will refer you anymore UUURA rolling_on_the_floor_laughing The same reason pagume will be  is some how the same as why pagume will be  just every  years BTW why do we have  days per year Why not  or  Because the earth takes  days to orbit around the sun Yah The patterns of the season becomes perfect  when it is count in  days Unless we might see a rainy season in christ mas It would be difficult for the farmers to prepare Yeah time the earth takes to complete a full revolution around the sun If we miss counting  day a year After  years the rainy season will start around August How can we know today is monday How can we Looking at the calendar grin How can we UUFVTUTV Do you know Ethiopians have  moths The th month is known as ጳጉሜ Pagumie meaning Addition It has  days only unless the year is leap year it will be  Tomorrow the day will be Pagumie  September  Amazing Uh
Happy New Year for Ethiopians heart Why is the reason Pagume becomes  and  I can not justify that but according to the international organization for standardisation monday signifies the beginning of the week
Culturally sunday signifies the start of a new week
we have  days per weekand we have  years since the creation of human being
Number of days  days since creation
Number of days divided by  will be day of the week In a single day we have  minutes extra and in one month we have about hrs and  minutes extra So every  years they add up to be  day And by the way in Ethiopian Orthodox Church Pagume  is known as እለተ ምሪኣ  እለተ መድሃኒት  We have  hours  minutes uncounted every year So the  hours will become a day in  years and the  minutes will be compounded for the th day UUGJPC It is every  years my mistake And its going to be on  EC Pagume will be  UUGJPC you should not refer him early give him a chance to think twice rolling_on_the_floor_laughing Thank you Zelalem Unlucky us So we wont see that event The th day What if the concept of reincarnation works That would be interesting UUFVTUTV and UUGJPC from where would you guys be reincarnated Hell or Heaven grin rolling_on_the_floor_laughing Probably hell Confess your sins the end is near man UUFVTUTV will for sure be from hell The probability of from hell or heaven will be determined by based on the input data What if the input data is not enough Are you going to be send back to the earth face_with_rolling_eyes And get another life As a ghost would be fun Imagine haunting the people you know in person that would be epic UUGJPC  the required dataset is already defined grin That would be fun oh yah got it UUFVTUTV Guys You should wash yourself in the morning before the bird drinks from the river Using soap isnt allowed At which time the bird start drinkinggrin  EAT Noted",0.009929311,0.39236316,0.59770757
2022-09-06,"Are we asking these questions to our CEO to make the recommendation
Or are we asking these questions ourselves in order to make a recommendation to our CEO I think we ask ourselves to have an understanding about the platforms and ask our CEO questions in order to make a clear and concise recommendation A perfect question shows your level of knowledge and then asks for further information to help you make a decision Hello everyone I cant attend todays career exercise stundup Could you share with me the ideas riased there Example  if you are asking your neighbour to dinner OK question  Where do you want to eat Better question  Its dinner time there is a nice place around the corner serving pasta should we go there or could you share me recorded video link Even better question  I know that you are fasting today and can only eat after nightfall  There is a place that is open late and serves light meals and juice before that  Are you open to eating so late You show that youve understood the context and the situation Youre  asking yourself these questions so you come up with relevant recommendations  I might mistaken things but these skills are more useful for the interviewer than the interviewee right

 for all those who struggle with dvc
 credits goes to UUKLBR for those links
  this video helped me alot
   But does it works for time data  For time data forward fill is good I think Is there anyone who successfully connected colab with DVC on GitHub do we have to do it necessarily It was mentioned on task  but I am not sure
maybe for the sake of  GPU
UUPVQ and UUKLBR what do you think please lets join the standup here  can anyone give me an idea on how to analyze sales behavior on holidays please Did you notice like me that there is two different  in stateholiday you can plot the series of sale of each value Can you elaborate more please I cannot make a distinction between them Im surprised I think it have to be cleaned Okay thanks And how can I manage Im now noticing it Ive found the problem one is string and one is int Yea that why data type casting is a must do we put all the csv files into gdrive and add them all as raw data into dvc to be tracked OR
 merge them put it in gdrive and then add the merged csv file into dvc how could the dvc remote works dvc init
git remote add d remotename gdriveFolderID
git commit m sets dvc remote
dvc add path_to_data
git add path_to_datadvc
git commit m datatrack
git tag a v m raw data
dvc push Hello guys I am not clear on which part of the data EDA is to be done Thanks check the weekly challenge documents There are guides on how to do a good eda Task  Not me
did you install the recommended package Ooh I just saw you did this is exactly where i am at no solution for it online too may be try to find the whl file and install it manually sometimes in windows this approach fixes it UUKLBR can you shed some light please yeah this library was causing errors for me too
i used another way to read data from the dvc instead of using get_url use  also for UUGQV

data  dvcapireadpathpathreporepo revrev
df  pdread_csvioStringIOdatalow_memoryFalse
return df sad to hear that UUGQV but I tried to pass the error using local storage Since the problem is with google drive  I stopped storing the data on google drive nad just used local storage There is no thing that says use google drive explicitly as long as you use DVC I think we can use local storage yeah i am also going through that route thanks fish Thanks UUJGPC i will give it a try It actually worked thanks UUJGPC I think we have to do to all Particularily using the test and train datasets  join the session The housing data on week  drive whats the use I believe it is for tutorial session UUKLBR we have about  datasets here but the store dataset is not a time series data until we merge it with either the train or test datasetcan we handle missing values in the store dataset as a non timeseries data or should we merge the datasets first and treat them as a time series data I think you handle the missing values in store And after you can merge And of course that data in store are not ts Its my opinion Is this a question of whether we have to use DVC creating a virtual environment works thank you guys I made a mistake of doing this in the wrong folder What should i do please Generally if your data isnt related to the timestamp and have no seasonality or trend you can handle that with the normal waymean median Just do it again in the right one dvc add path_to_data

When I replace path_to_data with my google drive path to the data i got this error message

unexpected error  gdrive is supported but requires dvcgdrive to be installed No module named dvc_gdrive

I have already set the gdrive folder containing the file as the remote folder What i want to do now is track it so i can generate a dvc file that would be tracked by git hey guys I faced this problem  you could easily
pip install gdrivefs    path_to_data is the path to your local data storage not gdrive okay but the data is already in the gdrive folder Does that means its best if i dont already have the files in the folder hey just type
pip install dvc_gdrive 
in terminal UUJNYC let me know if it worked  UVHMRPGQ did that then tried to add the gdrive file again but got this error  ERROR Outputs outside of DVC project UUKLBR it is a gentle reminder for sharing resources for handlining missing data in TSA git remote add d remotename gdriveFolderID
git commit m sets dvc remote
dvc add path_to_data
git add path_to_datadvc
git commit m datatrack
git tag a v m raw data
dvc push and if you did not install gdrive
pip install dvcgdrive where will dvc push to i got this when i tried to install gdrive with your code above
no matches found dvcgdrive Will dvc be tracking the file on my local machine or the file in my gdrive Will dvc be tracking the file on my local machine or the file in my gdrive it will track those  added into the remote gdrive
you can even try by deleting from the local data path by
dvc pull could you elaborate more UUKLBR Are we going to use mlflow for task  if were just doing data exploration It is not required for task Ok thank you Yaa but why is it stated as a deliverable on the challenge document It means that by Wednesday we should be working on task  The aim of mlflow is to track the models So we dont need that for data exploration UUURA but the deliverable for Wednesday is task  You asked for resources on handling missing values right in time series analysis
yes you made my day UVHMRPGQ 

 Thank you UUKLBR say that I have misunderstood the problem laughing UUKLBR can we get the notebook for todays tutorial as well Yes kind of I tried that and this happened
 sorry for you bro Thanks for the reply what i found out was the files to be tracked with dvc should not already be in the gdrive remote folder happy to hear that UUJNYC my files were already in it i tried dvc pull and it doesnt work I sincerely hope they fix it

PS dvc pull worked only after pushing first

PSS  dvc get can get your files from a url in case you dont have your files on your locale machine Anyway Thanks a lot guys blush UUKLBR thank you for those info so after get basic knowledge about fill missing data in the time series analysis
I feel that filling those  columns with previous tsa filling methods is logical
CompetitionOpenSinceMonth   
CompetitionOpenSinceYear
but what I cannot find it realistic is filling those  columns 
PromoSinceWeek        
PromoSinceYear        
PromoInterva           
because they are not existed and filling them will make data bias because it will get some stores running a promotion  which is promo that multiple stores participate on it while others dont 
how that come  I couldnt understand the purpose of filling them UUKLBR
UUPVQ
UTXVNH
UUUNMRX Based on my understanding you can feel CompetitionOpenSinceYear with the minimum year value and  for CompetitionOpenSinceYear you can use the st month which is  since CompetitionOpenSinceMonthYear  gives the approximate year and month of the time the nearest competitor was opened we can conclude that the nearest competitor was opened way before this store is opened so I dont think it wont be bias I agree with you but my point was for the other  columns
PromoSinceWeek        
PromoSinceYear        
PromoInterva          
filling them when the are not suppose to be filed for my side what I have done was put  for the interval and  for the other two reason being all those null values appear in the same row which means no promo ever applied makes more sense no promo ever applied refers to that  means no interval promosinceweek  and year too I hope I am clear yes I totally agree with you can you elaborate more on this answer
 If both CompetitionOpenSinceYear and CompetitionOpenSinceMonth  are null for a particular row I concluded based on an intuition there was already a competition when the store is opened and thats why I imputed the values with the min year from the store dataset and  as the month Is it clear please correct me if I am wrong you answer is clear but dont you think that maybe another reason have the effect for example there is no competition  I thought of that but how would you represent that as a value for the columns thats why I have gone with the other approach I think it is required just the screenshot of the functional mlflow setup Sorry for the delay I will upload it to the drive rn I made a mistake of doing this in a wrong folder what should i do no rent paid in month  but no free lunch Yeah no rent paidgrin",0.022503354,0.781444,0.19605264

 you can replace the  string with

trainDayOfYear  trainindexday_of_year parse_date was true and date was set as index while reading the csv into dataframe how to used the version of my data in gdrive in my script
I use dvcapiget_url but I cant see the mistake use this
content dvcapireadpathpath reporepo revversion
df  pdread_csvioStringIOcontent sep dvcapiget_url gt has caused a problem for me too what do you put in repo the local path to the folder or the git link the base folder if you are in the notebooks use gt  otherwise use  do I have to import any library before using ioStringID import io if you are in the notebooks use gt   where otherwise use  for the repo Yes 
repo   If you are writing the line of code in your notebook directory you should use  to tell your code that ur base directory is outside the notebook folder If you are writing your line of code in the script folder you do the same But if your file is in the base folder already you tell your code that your repo is in the base using  Of course we are talking about the repopath to the folder repo   gt mean one step back
repo   gt on this folder No you dont necessarily have to use colas for development You can use vscode or your preferred platform What is entered in place of  version You can use the tag you created with git Im getting this error pydrivefsspecGDriveAuthError Failed to authenticate GDrive Did the gdrive authenticated correctly while you configure your remote Yes I even pushed So how did this error come Hello guys Do you know a way that is faster for reading data from gdrive The way I am using is making me to wait a decade grin I am using this method and its rather quick for me atleast  I am using this one and it is so slow

 it is slow but it works fine for me Are you using GCP service accounts UUGJPC How many minutes does it take for you Thats even very slow on the github server UUJGRNE UUGQV No I am using my private gdrive for me fetching the train data takes around  minute or so but around  minute for the test data  does it run slow for the test data too The test data is better But i am running tests on the github action and thats is not tolerable It has taken  minutes and it is still running UUGJPC I also thought that and went on to configure dvc to use service account but faced some issues and removed them But for your case i think u need to setup service account because github is trying to access gdrive with no authorization Oh Yah I will try that please do tell me how you did it if you manage to make it work Im getting error to read data from gdrive I seriously need help For this submission I used the manuel way checking out to the version that I want However it might be import to read from my gdrive for the coming tasks Im getting pydrive error token expired or revoked And not able to connect to drive Also how to able my git repository to recognize the tag versions when running cml Another challenge for me Thanks how many days are yall considering for the sales during holidays analysis what is your DVC version I think this error went away for me when I update it to the latest version How about the salary Rossmann Dick from Rossmann pharmaceutticals",0.005833254,0.5734147,0.4207521

UUGVFN UUHAGTR UUDRQH Yeah the point was that Ive failed the first time the it was compromised I dont know how to refresh that I was not able to find the credential json file and modify it Then Ive used an other method of connexion using google cloud api You might find it in the same article you sent And then I can push I think to access I have to find the way to access it via the new token the one using the new app on google cloud But I dont know how to it or how to refresh the revoked token channel We will have a session on DVC to clear up things right after herokus session setupsh  for Heroku                                              mkdir p streamlit

web streamlit run serverenableCORS false serverport PORT apppy Can someone explain why we need to use Heroku if we are using streamlit dashboard already I dont understand what is the difference between the two We need it to deploy the dashboard I think you can deploy to the web by just using stream lit too We use Heroku to make our dashboard available to everyone Heroku is another option Does stream lit has that kind of feature UUFNPEUX Heroku is a hosting platform like godady aws etc UUFWPNCE I dont really get the meaning of deploy in this context Can you elaborate Havent tried it but yes UUGJPC  Oaky Thats good UUJKJGRAQ  
I will probably use an example to make it clear
Suppose you want everyone to access your dashboard every time but if you shutdown your laptop everything will go off including your application So if you deploy it on cloud it is like hiring another service to keep your app and run all the time oh  this is a clear difference thank you for explaining UUFWPNCE channel dvc and mlflow debugging session is about to start People facing issues are encouraged to join in Could you share us the link I thing Heroku is more convenient when multiple peoplelocations want to acess your app  Platform Google meet

     Here is the overall basis  before you can help your CEO choose between those  cloud options ie before you can recommend any of them  what are those questions she needs to answer basically her answers will influence your recommendation If I say something like   Im not sure what to have for breakfast  help me decide  pancakes jollof rice or chickenmayo sandwich  
Possible questions will include
 Which one doesnt take long to cook 
 Which aligns with your current diet 
 Do you have complete ingredients for any of them 
 Which do you think will fill you more before lunch time 
 What did you have for breakfast the day before  Clear And to ask those questions its a must to know how to cook all the three Right UTTKEYCF  Perhaps for the exercise sake  the CEO is familiar with all  options but just need to pick  Should we include all the questions in the report Or just the refined ones UUFNPEUX you should include all of them   paragraphs  Correct Thank you UVHMRPGQ UTTKEYCF  Okay let me reframe the question to see if I have understood it

 I already know my role in the startup

its cml publish not cmlpublish  pray UUVHCVKB The error is fixed by using  uses iterativesetupcmlv ok I imagined you used that thought the problem was with the  sign heavy_check_mark i_love_you_hand_sign in task  what does that mean
In our case you have a few datetime columns to preprocess you can extract the following from them
 weekdays
 weekends 
 number of days to holidays
 Number of days after holiday
 Beginning of month mid month and ending of month
 think of more features to extract extra marks for it
 do I need to create new datasets and If I should create a columns  what is the content of each column Creating a new columns will be best for the task The content of number of days to holidays for example would be an int of number of days till the next holiday and Number of days after holiday will be an int of numbers of days after the last holiday This can be helpful but Im yet to implement it myself  you can define a function like this it is not complete  but I think it might help you def split_datedf

venv

it will ignore this folder from tracking How does fixing mixing values before splitting data for model evaluation lead to data leakage How do I use label encoding on the state holiday column It has both integer and strings  I faced this same error sometime when I switched from Linux to windows maybe that was causal or maybe it was not Anyways what I did was instead of trying to figure out what happened and why I just pulled my latest commit from GitHub and added simply continued doing the task Lucky for me I did not do much after my last commit also I commit a lot in order to solve these kinds of problems in the future I learnt this the hard way frequent commits are really underrated Hello channel

2022-09-12,"Hello way better hi guys I think it will be better to use a channel than a discussion which will change each time when we add someone Hello UUGQV Hello Hi guys Natnael here wave Im Josias from Benin Amanuelvskintone Hi guys Hello UUJKJGRAQ  Is development pipeline an equivalent of a development branch in git What exactly is an llm prompt What does it do The prompt is the input you give to a Large Language Model and is the best way to influence its output One of the reasons why Large Language Models have taken the world by storm is their ability to manipulate or generate text for a wide variety of purposes without much instruction or training

Having been trained on large amounts of content already the model can often produce the right outcomes based on a simple task description In the world of LLMs and Generative AI this task description is called a prompt Hi guys feel free to add me to a study group gt This is great UUJNYC  UUKLBR UUPVQ UUDBREG UVLHPDME No its not Development branch in gitHub forms part of GitFlow
When we talk of development pipelines these are more inclined towards your Machine Learning process and the steps conducted there All or  a few of the steps could be defined into a single pipeline such that for example when you feed in data itll always give you a certain output say a serialized trained model maybe accuracy scores etc Thank you for the reply

So whats the best way to recreate development pipeline and production pipeline on GitHub Hello Ready to be added to any study group Hi guys Have you started forming study groups Do you have the text prompt yes

 we will divide the reading materials based on our number 
 every assign group of two or one person will discuss their reading materials and come up with questions
 we will run group meeting tomorrow for about hour and give every person group time to explain his assigned reading material for the rest of the group  
 we will use QFT for discussion
 Then every one go and read the other materials

Hope youre doing great
What are we saying about the materials Were suppose to share and discuss in other to learn from all the documents shortly Consequently well need to talk But no reaction so far How are we going to proceed Any suggestion Were already Tuesday Whos ready which document What about the feedback I think were working solo Is that going to help us I agree with you I just started going over the materials but if anyone has shown some progress please lets share it maybe we can divide the bullet points and tackle them individually and latter on present our findings and understanding to the group on Gmeet have you guys seen what mohammed posted nan that a great idea UUVHCVKB thanks man So I am reading more about the prompt and incontext learning part may be some of you can read about the others so we can effectively present to eachother maybe sounds good so group when shall we host the meeting  channel Can we discuss tomorrow before the standup meeting but how are we doing so far guys am UTC Im okay with that anyway Im also okay with the time Thats sounds good to me too It is okay with me as well Great UUJGPC kindly share the link on time Join
 join us for the standup  Hello guys yesterday I didnt attend the standup and the tutor What did I miss during yesterdays session Can anyone tell me what was happening Me too bro try to start from the challenge overview



then proceed to the LLM intro tutorial  Thanks Hello everyone
Let me please be sure about something
For this week technical challenge were going to apply different models to our data right Afterwards we will compare their results However their is a classification objective Wed like to know which new is more relevant for a given topic by attributing scores

Hope I have a good understanding of the practical work to do Because Im reading so far and Im kinda afraid about what to do in other to not miss the objective Im also thinking about my github Since were going to submit a link to our repo same here UUPVQ Following up on a question I asked on the Standup on terminology

Is there a particular term a name for the code we are going to produce for this weeks challenge

The challenges document refers to it  only as MLOps pipeline to use LLMs  and This weeks challenge is to systematically explore strategies that help generate prompts for LLMs strategies to design prompts are reproducible and produce a consistent result UUPVQ UUJKJGRAQ Help us answering your question by providing some context  why do you want the answer to this question  Whats the context around when you will use this answer The ongoing session by Yabebal provides more insights on the challenge I hope UUH that the session is helping with your understanding what happend did the meeting end did the meeting cut off rejoin yeah  UUJKJGRAQ question broke the gmeet  haha  she really was asking great questions UUGNNVB I was just curious about the terminology
I was trying to answer the question 

what will we produce for this week challenge

I think the answer is MLOps pipeline to use LLMs but I was wondering whether there is a specific term for this kind of code this is really exciting think about it I dont think there is anything you can not make it do if you have the right context prompt and other parameters to finetune your input parameters can someone add me to their study group i have not joined yet really nice project this week Yeah i have added you to ours got it thanks Very interesting Hello guys I have not joined any study group till now Can anyone invite me to your group I dont think theres a more detailed naming for what well produce The MLOps pipeline for using LLMs seems right UUPVQ Thank you for the answer Just to remind you the study groups are to help with the understanding of this weeks challenge To help divide and conquer the concepts in this weeks challenge They do not equate to a group work and therefore the work will not be graded as a group Everyone should have their own work in their own repository Also just to ask who is on MacOS here I am Hi All I have updated the challenge document to make it clear what needs to be delivered as well as to clarify some of the tasks let me know what else is not clear and I will update it to make it clear I am also on MacOs Thanks UUUNMRX Just to update this UUJKJGRAQ  I hope youve seen the update on the challenge document The response here would change to an API So well target to produce an API that can be used to score documents Nikola Tesla and Albert Einstien  references prepost I dont see you theresmile you should train it to know Fisseha nice one UVNLSU Its the pants on the first image for merolling_on_the_floor_laughing It seems weirdsmiley to me Is that Lincoln flushed they done gave him a Tenefanefsweat_smile Lets keep the images coming And use the CTBUCUUDrandom channel Elon Musk and Eienstien How did you download the files for this weeks challenge You copy the content from git hubdownload too for the excel part you can download the whole file as a csv cant found download button on github there is copy all button create a json file on your pc and paste the content or you can just copy the link and paste it in a downloader but at the end you have to convert it to json Alright thanks Id appreciate a very good youtube link that helps you set up cmlmlops how about this  Thank you Thamar Welcome dear great Im in UVHMRPGQ Can we take your idea and duplicate UVHMRPGQ Alright its fine UUGBTMY sorry our group is full now apologies UUGNNVB absolutely yes I would be very happy if that helped others UUPVQ UTACUUW Could you figure out how we can duplicate this UUUNMRX fyi yes pray Hello everyone the exercise for week  Tools for Remote Work has been returned  Please see  list Thank you our power have been cut off and I have limited power in my laptop when the career exercise will start and I dont think it will be enough for watching tutorial and submitting the task do I need to turn it off and come back after  mins  UULLSTG UTTKEYCF Sure channel we are going to start exactly  utc If I group an email as to be replied by me will I have to write the email reply in the submission document UTTKEYCF UULLSTG Yes  brief It just started Thank yougrinning Where is the doc I can not see it same i cant see too waiting same same is it in career file  i cant see it either doc not still available I dont see it  Make a duplicate of the doc for yourself and edit it
 
  hope so its  Where is the doc it is shared ok already  past  it has been shared I couldnt find the doc  Please find the email template in your folder Alternatively   PLEASE DO NOT WORK IN THE DOC  MAKE YOUR OWN COPY  channel please lets ignore the date May  and assume it recent  September do we write our flags on the justification section UTTKEYCF You mean  flagged for later  yeah like important mail the CEO need to deal with do we need to tell our actions responded to immediately forwarded directly     UUJGPC Yes you need too If you think an email needs to be responded to immediately  write a brief email on behalf of the CEO

If you think it should be ignored  just write ignored  then under justification put why you chose to ignore  eg not relevant private etc so what others options do we have other than replying and ignoring can we use the acronyms like CTO CFO to represent the email receivers name Reply forward ignore flag for later If you mean
Dear CTO  Sure yeah thanks what if the  email is important but the CEO need to answer herself because I dont have the info to answer it You assume you are the CEO I guess You Assume what would the answer be if you are the CEO Great Youre required to answer to emails that you are able to respond to flag emails that require her attention and forward messages that you believe other departments are better suited to handle How to submit submission is on google classroom youre welcome to submit as you see fit pdf or doc A link to my Google doc yes provided it is accessible to anyone with the link channel here  minutes to gosmiley channel what do you thinkfeel about the exercise smiley Challenging Interesting why challenging  some how intersting I learned how comfortable it is to think as a CEOsmile

 passing tasks to others some how grin Ayeeeeeeerolling_on_the_floor_laughing I wanna be a CEO wink God when Wow just wowsmile
There were good experiences to read about Is the exercise built upon the role of a personal assistant to  CEO raised_hands We expected to manage all email and i tried  my best to do better with in a hour I felt like one One hour is a lot shorter than I thoughtsmiling_face_with_tear It was a bit confusing I am still not sure am I responding on behalf of the CEO or being the CEO yeah me too UUHAGTR Asking me if you should should grant a budget I didnt approve rolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughing it is really challenging  to make decision on behalf of CEO Isnt on behalf same as being Cool then you could really be a good CEO joy why is it challenging You can decide whatever you believe is good I think that is easywink I also was conflicted on what to reply I felt like the CEO had to be involved in almost all of them no Because If I am the CEO I can directly take decisions or approve budgets for example

if I am writing on the behalf of the CEO I have to ask the CEO for hisher permission to write any approval or decision Right the idea is to see what you can respond to within the time limit Believe it I wanna be blush smiley That is why time management is so crucial white_check_mark UVNLSU me too Sad actually lights went out and I submitted when light comes plus it is not finished The CTO was so lazy and all his tasks were undone except one report I was so upset I was really about to fire him grin TUTORIAL REMINDERtimer_clock  here UTEPYRMP UUUNMRX

Why Too overbearing and decisive sometimes First impression Smart and intelligent

Why Cos I used to read widely its all surface intelligent bro nerd_face First Impression Most people think I am unapproachable

One time i was walking on the street and met a long lost friend and she almost walked past me I stopped her and asked her if she didnt recognize me and she said she thought i was looking to dodge her because I was frowning First impression careless
Why  usually i focus on urgent issues Same here raised_hand_with_fingers_splayed First Impression sleepy
Why I used to sleep all day all night First impression consider me as a terrorist  during Ethiopian revolution 
Whydue to my hijab
An incident that happenedentrance of AAU Which is not wrong impression Funny people that you actually try to dodge wouldnt mind the frowned face First impressionsome people think am not friendly some how with murderer thoughts
Why I think its because I dont communicate easily First impression consider me as a serious and not friendly 
Why may be I dont initiate a conversation Oww sorry yigermal Same here I wish I have murderer thoughts First impression  People think that I am very serious
Why  I hardly speak until I need to
An incident that happened  When I go to new places people speak to me like I am an old person  serious and jokes aside Let secrets stay in our groupsjoy I pretend i am on a call to try to dodge people sweat_smileUUJNYC what about you Funny one 
First impression whenever I joined a new school my classmates think Im mixedwestern father n maybe Ethiopian mother
Why  maybe since my fathers  name is Alexander which is not an Ethiopian name n the fact that I have a little bit of light skin  First impression people think that I am a very serious and quiet person
Why I dont know why they think like thatrolling_on_the_floor_laughing Noted First Impression People think I am older than I am
Why My hairline Welcome to the league grinning Ohh murderly What about when united wins Who will start the conversation First impression Im an extrovert  Why because I speak up a lot  An incident that happened I once missed a great opportunity because of not voicing myself and lowkey pushing myself to improve my communication skills in every platform I get Fun fact Im an introvert Being bald at a young agegringrin rolling_on_the_floor_laughing  I still believe you are old UUFQKEMV same But you do seem an extroverted person Half or full bald first impression that im looking for a fight

 Why I just enjoy talking to people mostly strangers
 An incident that happened i got my first job just for a random conversation on a random topic i had with  someone i met while travelling  Calls looking the other side walking faster and if you still stop me or shout my name I gotta make it very brief with Im late for work UUFVTUTV I think you are full bald unless you wouldnt ask this question Have you ever been in a fight Bald is actually one of the characteristics of smart and knowledgeable people UVNLSU i bet youre not an introvert grinning i have i lost pensive I will agree with them Half cast rolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughing rolling_on_the_floor_laughing I am gonna put mine as story
its was back in my university freshman timewe had to choose one from the departments in the collegeI asked someone for an information about the selection process and apparently I was told not to put Software Engineering as my first option as it is difficult and especially for me because I was from the country sideI just said okay but later on at end of the semester  I scored actually  and that someone came to apologize for their misjudgment UUURA  Yeah it is sign of smart people UUGJPC I cant say I am offended You cant be responsible for other peoples thoughts wink It depends UVNLSU If it started in the front thats a sign of smartness But if it begins at the back thats different rolling_on_the_floor_laughing Lets go with Sign of samrt people PS Notice the typo laughing Exactly my point wrong impressionsweat_smile UUFQKEMV just kidding UUGJPC What if it starts in the middle We should study the reason behind that UUURA  rolling_on_the_floor_laughing If it is middle it is Sign of lake Whats going on here so many doctors in one thread that happened to a lot of country siders You did great choosing SE Many get frightened by a false prophet like the one you met So many balds too UUGJPC Ill talk to a stone if I couldnt fine a person joy ALRIGHT GUYS THIS WAS IT FOR TODAY LETS GET READY FOR THE NEXT SESSION THANK YOU FOR SHARING

If you havent share yet you can still share it here
Other than that have a nice moment a head Yeah I was lucky actually I had offered a computer training opportunity back in high schoolI was already familiar with at least the computersBut you are right many were frightened I have encountered a lab assistant who gives less scores for country siders thinking that they cant code So youre not seriousgrinning I like this thread joy Haha I dont want to hear the day you loose rolling_on_the_floor_laughing I think you wont talk until you win again UUURA are you bald  Ethiopian  UUGJPC yeah he is bald Nope there is no way in hell very unfortunate Imagine trying to learn from him Im hilarious and funzany_face Yeah very sad If you want I would donate my hair to you UUFVTUTV And the saddest part was he was a great programmer is no beard considered bald The Ethiopians I know have light skin UUURA your hair is not compatible I thought its common there I would not call him great with that mindset UUGQV Thats called double bald extra bald gringrin UUURA okay beard mansmiling_face_with_tearjoy We have another case UUGQV doesnt have a beard The other saddest part was he was a recent graduate he joined as a lab assistance right after he graduated I still dont how he end up like that Beardless and Baldies over here grin Yeah rock style ohhh its really sad They way you talk makes you sound an introvert trying to communicate I can relate joy Lets see them beards UUURA lol I think it was my dataset It was too large My RAM was completely used up I was using a GPU on Google Colab I always try my best to communicate as much as possible even though Im an introvert Thanks UUGQV gringrin They are my precious gifts I had them since Gr  UUFVHFNF Prove them wrong thats the way to go about stereotyping muscle u did great my men I might be stuck in Gr smiling_face_with_tear UUGQV is Nati lying Probably I didnt even know what beard was in Gr  smile UUGJPC Its kinda common but my fathers name plays part a lot its not common to have a foreign  name in Ethiopia almost  of names are local If he had a beard in GR  He is now  What a calculation ofcourse he is  or  No actually I anger is short lived I dont get too attached UUURA You have some explaining to do Why are you all against me Now I am so frightened Ayzon atfra inji Belefelefu be af yitefu you called me double bald remember lol Balds vs you UUURA Any ways UUGQV UUFVTUTV UUGJPC All of you are beardless baldies I aint afraid of you Owww UUGJPC are you bald UUGJPC Sorry if you are not bald collateral damage my man Nope I m not my hair is zoma And my beard is afro Collateral Damage rolling_on_the_floor_laughing Ere zm yishalal Wisdom of God afro be zoma I didnt know  baldness is a big deal that deserves this mega thread joy my prayer goes to those who are on their way to baldness Are you on the way UUDRQH UUDRQH And also for the beardless ones Nope Im good joy Noted beardless UUFVTUTV It includes you too Nope i am goodjoy Nah I highly doubt that  First impression I like to say hello all people I got infront of me funny ahhgrin
 Why It is a habit in most rural areas of Ethiopia and I have been grown via this system
 An incident I have been blessed by elder Once I walk alone I meet an older man and said _good evening father_ and continued my journey The  old man then called and blessed me for about  minutes  Because this habit is now destroying and they always miss it I was so happy and Ill never forget that moment  I generated your future photos UUURA UUFVTUTV UUDRQH UUGQV Pick yourself rolling_on_the_floor_laughing The present UUFVTUTV is number  I am very sure all  have beards UUGQV  nice great disprove Im stealing this habitsweat_smile I know what you mean stealing good habits is a good habitsweat_smile did you rest on Sunday Good job Did you rest on Sunday Did you rest on Sunday You can finish it after B Whats the blocker You can finish after the training Did you rest I didnt unfortunately was working on the projects on Sunday too I will rest when I made it in lifewink Thanks for asking Arun Please please please dont work on Sundays You are a human Your brain needs rest Its like pretending that running without ever stopping will make you a better marathon runner Dont think short term  days on one day off Oh very much so I know That was a one time thing I will make sure to rest on Sundays yes it good actually  but not in the field of data science and ML like get off the screen Zero shot learning vs few shot learning  Attention

Video call link  I think we should have a meeting if the time is not convenient inform me We can adjust the schedule so that it will be okay for all hi is the time above in utc or eat utc for EAST it will be pm t pm in the evening right for eat it will be pm to pm i believe would it be possible to have it  mins later that is possible but do you mean starting at pm i mean starting at pm eat pm utc possible it works for me nice What issues should we discuss I am not sure about that shall we share just what we have been reading I was not available for todays tutorial provided by Yabebal I do not know what he said in addition to what he mentioned on Monday regarding the group study I have a suggestion on this we could start with design flowchart of the project then add all the features needed in every step What do you guys think Are we working on the same repo as week  i think its a whole new repo for this week I mean should we have the same repo as a group or do we work on our own separately seperate nan Thanks for the info Then our discussion should be as UVNLSU mention first See you at pm east Hello guys its time for our meeting Please join using the link provided   what does this mean  it means pytorch wont be in the companys metafacebook direct control it will become its own entity the Pytorch Foundation a subsidiary within the larger Linux Foundation got that UUGHTV  but what does it mean in terms of competition with other frameworks and development i am thinking lots of contribution to the development of pytorch from the AI community what about tensorflow vs pytorch tensorflow is still maintained by google google has this TPU hardware to train huge deep learning models the device was designed to on tensorflow code base  guys whats our plan After we uderstand the document the dicussion will be after a last class if you make it at  ehtiopian local time I prefer becouse I will be on my way to addis afterr class end I think the deliverable is in tomorrow so we should divide the tasks and do them sooner that is great I like that we can do that let us ask yabibal at the time of tetural time becouse on the document it doesnt clearer indicate on the document I think he mentioned in the yesterdays overview that Wednesday  is the due date for task  and  summary so we can divide the resource of task  and  yeah bire sounds like a good plan yea i think  resource link there on the document so we can divide into five okay so just select  resource link from top to down in order
gtwith FIFO I will take all resources in
 Understand or at least acquire a reasonable familiarity with text generation with GPT GPT OPT Bloom etc like models Second topic  points the first three  points  How does incontext learning work A framework for understanding the differences from traditional supervised learning  SAIL Blog

 We should create a google doc and summarize the provided documents in there great THAT IS GOOD IDEA if no one has started creating the document yet I will create and share it with you guys i will take this one task 
 Understand the techniques of prompt engineering and setup MLOps pipeline for experimentation with different LLM models okay I will take
How does incontext learning work A framework for understanding the differences from traditional supervised learning UUEJR the total or  actually resources i will share with UUGRTXAP i will take the first  bullet so lets classify the documents in this way

Task  has three sub topics so
      Task   Genet
     Task   Yishak
     Task   Yohannes
Task 
      Task   Birhanu and Anteneh so when are we going to be meeting again i think its better after dinner for me like pm local time yes what about yishak and jo sure I agree

sorry for the delay bro that easy bro so we will meet at  local time yeah pm tonight perfect guys is there anyone who understand the career exercise fully i am not sure Guys If you had looked The challenge document has been updated so there are  sub tasks in task  and a total of  sub tasks in task  yea sure so we add on the previous one guys what do we have so far  I  will  try to put what I  read from the refrence document I think I have wrote yestararday about prons and cons bire ok from my side I didnt have the time to go through all of the materials but I am trying to fill up the document with the summary points ante yhans I havent heard of UUGRTXAP for a long time where is he pkay let me put what we have reviwed from the material and any of our group mmeber can use it may be he left to visit family for new year Hi can we discuss on gmeet UVVGQG i think you have our email so can you create a link and send to us yes we can Yes bire I will create it now Ante i was call to him before  minute He is available to join us on the gmeet  but slack was little bit difficult to him According to he said okay  Please geni jo yohanes also the connection is very slow guys my network is not working Okay bro we will update you I try to summarize task  What a hell I dont think the Ai seen the same Einestine image as the ones Ive seen Or was this when he was a lot younger joy Come on thats just someone sitting in front of you in a library smile UUDBREG i think   is a more realistic what the helljoy I love this ohhh I like this Who is who tho We need to find this exact spot for your wedding I will try it out This one winssweat_smile It looks like Vormir The one in Marvel the resting place of soul stone This is beautiful Also try  this guys
 you can prompt the wise with ultra realistic key work to get realistic images UUDRQH okay thank you that is also amazing Beautiful weird Scary and cute at the same time I can only imagine the things that were running in your head when choosing this prompt if this one is the one you actually chose to be politically correct

UUJKJGRAQ UUVHCVKB I have to admit that this was my sisters suggestion Really Ok then let us assume it was really your sister And not you I love this we should be mining the midjourney discord group for mapping world creativity with words and what are the common prompts people are using",0.052986704,0.61028314,0.33673012

Video call link  I am struggling I need help The previous weeks have been very challenging for me Sometimes I dont even know how two steps connects For example I dont know which stage database population comes in and why its needed When I have multiple disconnections like this I feel overwhelmed and it affects my work for that week 

Ive realized that I work best when I have step by step guide of what needs to be done I know that our tasks are not provided in that format but going forward its the first thing I want to do on Mondays and I need you guys to help me with it So for week  This is as far as my understanding goes on the challenge 

 Read up extensively on LLP
   Set up dvc and cml
   jupyter notebooks EDA on the datasets
   Python Prompts engineering using API still not sure how to fine tune with this yet
  fastapi or flask API endpoint I dont know how to go about this or even if its step 
So guys help me out here if theres anything out of order or you have something to chip in on step  or  please reply Same here we all feel overwhelmed I personally started to think of this feeling as fun and something to look for something that I get to do instead of something I have to do And this attitude changed everything for me I think you are right
 Read and research on prompt engineering and its algorithms
    a understand transformer algorithm
    b understand basics of GPT
 Then I believe the next step after setting up your repo is EDA on the given datasets and customizing the data to get better performancesresults from the cohere api
    a you will be working on creating the best input data out of the given dataset
    b you consume the cohere API simply send you prepared data to the api and you receive predictions from the model
    c Finally you put all these steps together by creating your own API
    d your API should have two endpoint  i think they behave more or less the same one endpoint for the news scoring and the other endpoint for extracting entities from job description
        i So here is what you will do your api should accept datasetin json format possibly then you transform clean feature engineer the received data through your pipeline then send the prepared data to the cohere API notice there are two APIs involving in this projectthen you present the results via UI
Your API accept datagtyou transform data through pipelinegtsend prepared data to coheregt receive predictions gt return the results to the user via UI
That is wha I understood from the guidelinesplease remind me if I miss anything Also the best thing I think you can add to this is the schedule and planning part If you have for example  tasks to do it will be very beneficial for you to plan what to do and when to do it That way you will reduce overthinking and overcommitting on a single specific task Instead you will try to do all the tasks instead of overcommitting on a single topic or task that might be a blocker for you I do not practice what I just preached but I am trying to do that in order to have the max out of myself and my time Hope that makes sense Thank you Fish Im dealing with the overwhelming part what Im concerned about is my overall output for the week there seem to be no improvement UUJGPC Thank you That was pretty comprehensive Whats left is the technical howto for 

 fine tunning the prompts to yield best results and
 how to create endpoints for the API
Id appreciate a good resourcecode samples for these UUVHCVKB Thank you that was helpful UUJNYC creating endpoints API in general with fastapi library is pretty easy
just follow these few steps and you have your api running

type these command in order to run your api python m uvicorn mainapp reload or python m uvicorn mainapp reload

 I will update you as soon as I get something on fine tuning Guest talk on in less than  minutes  Its great that you asked UUJNYC Here is where the community comes into the play We know that the weekly project is challenging and using the community is the best thing to do Building api endpoints and interacting with available LLM apis is something we will cover on tomorrows session You can also use the reference provided by UUJGPC its very good For fine tuning please look at  article Its specific to cohere but the logic is the same for other platforms UUJGPC UUKLBR Thank you very much Your replies has given me a clearer view on how to go about the challenge technically 

This makes getting through less overwhelming blush in term of the code side I just read week doc and it confused me can any one explain what we should do  what we should deliver for the current submission
UUKLBR UUUNMRX I think it would be nice if you get API key from cohere or bloom and just do some basic requests on maybe prompt based text extraction and receive some output from the APIs Yes you need to setup your env to with different endpoints as it has been specified in the challenge document It would be a plus if you can connect with one of the available api and get data from the LLM model Please have a look at the rubrics section of the challenge document okay Thank you do I need to create same files every time I init a github repo  or there is a way to recreate it instantly  yes so that theyll be tracked by git I mean you have to create them I advice you to prepare a template Any help on how should I mask my api key  so that you dont worry about creating the file structures again and again i have the same question UUKLBR Any tip in Javascript I use env to store API keys and gitignore  I dont know if it is possible to do the same in python Is there anyone who manages to access the GPT API I am having this problem
Not available
OpenAIs API is not available in your country You can use pythondotenv  While you deploy you can add it as an environment variable You can use config for python how is that UUJGPC  If you use pythondotenv remember to add env file to gitignore  GPT api is not for free may be try using cohere they have free tier i thought about thatbut what happens when you publish your project I mean after all your putting it to the public right Tanks UUDRQH All env files work the some how the same way so while you publish every deployment platform provides environment variable which you can add to so unless the deployment platform is hacked your variable is safe this works for every languages env files how I can read the data in form that I could use Thanks guys I will try it This is the same way you publish your env variables in lets say some front end deployment like React or Vue so while you deploy you add your variables to the deployment platform you are using i just renamed the txt file into json how about the excel one  you can use pandas read_excel is it not working Which api key are you using open ai is not available in my country Use cohere they have a free one alright thanks Thanks you all again I have used dotenv and it worked fine just download it as a csv file and use pandas read_csv are you trying to do this finetuning using code or the GUI also there is a method in pandas to read excel files isnt there looks more like Tesla Yeah I see Einstein but I think Elon Musk has refused to go back in timejoy  since he doesnt want to leave SpaceX behindjoy my problem was on my laptop battery and it was very challenging for me I had only  min before my battery goes off But I really enjoy it Hello channel I hope you are well just a polite reminder on to tomorrows career session as mentioned before we will be having a light interview stretch during the session  asking about the exercise reply with a fire if you would like to volunteer we need  ladies and  guys This mock interviews will begin as from next week as for tomorrow we will have a sparring session where we will pick randomly fire here REMINDERtimer_clock  UUGULUY Todays standup  will start in min Join the meeting with this link below

 Hello can we make it at  Hello Yes sure yeah Should we use yesterdays link sure does degaga have to be the one to let us in The link is not working i dont know why  Sorry guys but I am not able to talk But I will be listening  for the selfattention
   We can convert the scoring problem into multiplechoice  I watched yesterdays orientation by Yabebal he was hinting at that too for example if the score is gta gtb and so on it may require preprocessing the given data before we give it to the models converting the score column to multiple choice
What do you think I think we can train the LLM by giving it examples of topics and their scores can it give us number which means it will be doing regression this sounds about right i think preprocessing in this case would mean rotating the data to understand our prompts right I think if we give it topics with each scores itll be like a classification problem with multiple choices yes yabebal had mentioned that we could convert it from a regression problem to a classification one by having thresholds if the score is an integer yea that is possible but what if the score is a continues number including the decimal hi guys just to summarise what we said we would do when we meet again

one minute summaries of the following concepts from the rubric
 word embedding
 positional embedding

 transformer algorithms

this is what i have so far from each person but im sure i didnt get what every one said theyd present so please let me know
margaret  
gedion   
haylemicheal  
degaga  
wangui   

so each person would be presenting  concepts with overlap hopefully  questions  sounds good Sounds good Only Reference_Final_score has decimals and the document says its not relevant for now but the two columns Analyst_Average_Score and Analyst_Rank are both integers So at what time is our next meeting Thanks Wangui sounds good okay got it Does an hour after our last tutorial sound good for our next meeting Are we giving it the topic or is it going to come up with its own topics Like how we created a word cloud analysis on twitter data it just counts the number of words overly used We give the topic from the data provided to us that works so our next meeting is going to be at pm eat tentatively Thats good Hello here shall we start our meeting Yeah we can Let use this mornings link Good can I join you guys in  Sure UUJGRNE could you join the meeting right now        we must account for the fact that a word can mean different things to different neighbours Consider the following example marygaverosestosusan
 We see that the word gave has different relations to different parts of the sentence mary expresses whos doing the giving roses expresses whats being given and susan expresses who the recipient is In a single selfattention operation all this information just gets summed together If Susan gave Mary the roses instead the output vector gave
 would be the same even though the meaning has changed We can give the self attention greater power of discrimination by combining several self attention mechanisms these are called _attention heads_ this was the example I was looking for      hi are we still to meet at  am eat today Ada suggested Sam Harris to understand awareness as a soft skill

2022-09-15,"You have to add more samples to your txt file UUURA ok but we have only  samples right Yes what I did was take few samples from the test and preprocess it the same way I preprocess the training data and create tuned model just to check if it improves while I am requesting generation Morning all  We are starting the standup now please join    i did both  channel Those of you who have a problem with cohere API key contact me or reply in this tread we can solve that specific problem together so it still did not work
UVHMRPGQ UUVHCVKB could you share with me any resources to use cohere I mean step by step until you get to fine tune the results Cohere is working for me
DeepAI and others are not working UUGZJP where are you right now I mean progress UUH I did not start using other API other than cohere  Fish could you host a meeting and invite anyone who wants to follow through UUVHCVKB I am just starting I support UVNLSU idea what time  UVNLSU UUVHCVKB It is better you Adjust the time and am in too can UUGBTMY UVNLSU UUGZJP make a  minute gmeet call now sure am okay what about UVNLSU Yes  yes This is a great reflection
 I dont even know how two steps connects  best to highlight through asking in slack when you notice that This is an important realisation and finding a quick way to fill the gap is essential
  I dont know which stage database population comes in and why its needed  again this is great realisation  I always have to deal with it myself everyday It is exactly here I know I will grow to the next level  when I find the solution to understand why this is needed I will read contextualise and try to see it from a Google manager or Facebook engineer point of view to scale the problem and put the stake high   when I have step by step guide of what needs to be done  everyone works best that way actually they just dont come that way Only artificial problems those without value actually have that nature The rest you have to deal with a vague instruction  You have to know there is little to be done from ones comfort zone It is the sweet pleasure of walking in the not so clear path but finding your way out and adding value that is the most essential Of course that said planning and making strategy around the problem and getting feedback from others makes life easy and significantly improves the quality and speed of the outcome You did exactly that in the other thread so you are in the right track what is the error it is giving you 

you could try using this gpt models api instead its free on huggingface UUUNMRX I appreciate your time and guidance Moving away from my comfort zone was part of the reason I joined X Now I have to let it do the job Ill make use of the community more and try to stick to the process I know that you and everyone is here because you didnt want to stay in your comfort zone The statement I used is as a general principle not particularly targeted to you You have come so far and keep up the good work Did the session started yes yes I circumnavigated this environment thing using a python file that I did not push to GitHub By assuming if and when we put this to deployment we can use the hosting machines environment variable and also tell me how you managed to fix it Have you solved the problem If not I can help i havent solved it yet id appreciate the help So I was recommended to use python dotenv and I have worked for me
Here the steps
pip install pythondotenv  
create env file and WRITE COHERE_SECUREPASTE YOUR API KEY HERE INSIDE IT 
ADD env file  in gitignore
Next put this on notebook
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

I searched for this thing after I was not able to read medium blogs for this weeks tasks because they are members only and one account has like  per week or I dont know the exact number So that being said I did not yet try it but I think it works not only on medium but it says on almost any paywall

Enjoy Or maybe you guys even knew about it before
 UUVHCVKB my approach is whenever I reach my free tire I just create a new account with a new email and password I thought I was the only one running out of free articles Incognito is the truthraised_hands  create temporary email UUGQV does incognito solve the paywall thing no but it does for mediums members only blogs thanks man UUGQV   nan   Data  vs data  whats the use of data   Data  is for the news artifact scoring

while i addin the file to the gdrive it says every thing is updated but nothing added to remote Is your default remote correctly set ssure UUHBCXDY try it by changing the conda envt The excel file has not been updated We can not then fine tune what conda yea sometimes the Anacondaconda virtual environment is stacked with dvc maybe if the problem occurs with that create a new virtual environment and try with that Having the same issue here I even tried to lematize the content UUURA How did you do UUH Am having the same issue here Even after lematizing it I am not able to get pass this issue Yeah The text are too long You can use embed UUH I am not sure about the Body one but for description it works fine Still lack of enough samples is an issue here You can not make accurate classification since we dont have enough samples for each classes we create yeah lack of enough sample to fine tune Yes this is a great issue embed I will try that Even if u classify it with  test data and the rest train data face_exhaling Its still not accurate because the two test data can only have the score  they cant have an other value since we dont have enough samples example we only have one value with  so even we label this and try to put it in the test set it will complain saying that specific label is new which means we have missed it in the training dataset Yeah thats actually a great problem I thought about tampering with the data but still dont see it as a perfect solution Yeah but anyway there are a lot of zero and only   There is no thing to classify and from  to  Its not interesting If you can come up with your own data like collect from the internet some news and give it a score based on intuition I think its the only way to proceed at least  rows Still not enough but it is better than what we have right now how can I access my api app and see each endpoint and see if it is working and what Ive done You can use postman or for vscode you can use RapidAPI its and extension How does it work Could you brief me  Thanks this video has a brief walk through Thank you If you hard time using post man you can use Rapid API Let me send you a resource on that  I need your help in preparing data for bot excel and text file What I suppose to do to make my data ready to send via api Could you elaborate more I already imported my excel file and I dont know what to do in the data to be ready to send as prompt in the api in terms of job description what should I do to make data ready  In terms of the news I guess using classify is more efficient than embed but since we have very limited sample and since classify has an example input limit you have to use embed but before proceeding to that I suggest you try to truncate the description and body with out loosing the context then try to group the data based on their analytic scores so like give a class for each score so for example you do first classify below  and above  then based on that class you do an other classification for the bottom and top classes since we have very limited data just try to classify it in a way that fits your approach then split your data and do the classificationembedding For the job description part try to come up in a way to send the content of the json as a prompt for example you can concat all the texts inside token which have the same entitylabel just make sure at the end you make it dynamic thank you UUURAI will try todo sothank yo very much I didnt see any suggestion as to how we can defend against prompt injection as we can in sql injection Youre welcome  DAILY STANDUP REMINDERtimer_clock  here

      Hey channel when youre done with the challenges please join here  to share various approaches everyone has used to solve the challenge  UUKLBR UUH why do we want to use HAVING instead of WHERE I just had a good look to the question and it was just a filtering problem right  we shall use HAVING only in grouping i think There is nothing to group here so why is it necessary to use having If we have a way to sum the result set we can do having I second you We use having clause if you need grouping and they dint specify if we will group anything Or I didnt understand it well Yes UUJGPC the population is already given and we dont even need an aggregation function That would definitely be something to look at UUURA We can try to use a sub query to sum up the results Sure then we all agree that we can only use a WHERE clause UUKLBR
I have managed to use subquery and count all the rows returned from group by but the out put of  having query was wrong it was supposed to be  but it is 

SELECT COUNT FROM select count from CITY 
group by district
having sumPOPULATIONgt  as A This should work Not sure why you are using district tho Can you try name SELECT COUNT FROM select count from CITY 
group by name
having sumPOPULATIONgt  as A Yes you were right name works having clause with district doesnt work because we are checking sum of populations of the districts not cities which means if we have  cities having population greater than  with the same district if we group the sumpopulation will treat them as  not  Nice this is implementing the solution in different ways and helps us to understand how to use the different available clause having clause here We need to look at the efficiency and simplicity of  the query we are going to use tho Flawlessraised_hands",0.029467199,0.6239176,0.34661525

 Generate a key locally
 sshkeygen t rsa b  C ltemailaddressgt
t type of encryption b  strength of encryption
 list the generated key
ls  grep ltkeynamegt
 copy your public key
cat ltkeynamepubgt Join us for the intro to the week challenge  To SSH into any remote machine you can use
  start the sshagent in the background 
 eval sshadd s gt
output  Agent pid 
 add your SSH private key to the sshagent
  sshadd ltpathToYourprivatekeyfilegtltyourPrivatekeynamegt UUDRQH and UUURA
I am not sure if that is how we should download thembut you can download the data by selecting dronedate and time
I tagged you guys because you were asking on Gmeet Anyone finding it difficult to open the service portal help me out Thanks bro Great In the tenx platform in the git performance I am in the below  on most of the fields  Can anyone tell me the best practices to improve those numbers Guys today we havent class No tutorial today UUHBCXDY
 youre welcome airflow db reset
this solved the above error however I still could not start the airflow webserver I tried both admin admin and airflow airflow  I dont think there is one rather u set it urself  how airflow users  create role Admin username admin email admin firstname admin lastname admin password admin UUFNPEUX  right skintone what if role admin already exists  i dont know about thatothers might help us here ok I did not know why and when the user admin was created but I solved this by creating a new user and give it a password and name and all and used this new user to log in to airflow webserver UUFNPEUX UUJGPC thank you both I have question do we consider dockerized projects as a cross platform application or projects  like application written in flutter  I am not sure how to respond to this question but I think the whole point of dockerization is so that we could run them in any environment This is easier  thank you I will share it in the resources channel I think that will add the downloaded data to postgres right Because dbt will need to access it

Will we create then a well structured database with the data This means creating tables right

Im thinking about how to put the data in postgres

Some clarifications and hint will help Thanks I circumvented this by creating another user with an admin role I also am in need of a good postgres connection with airflow tutorial MySQL is not working for me The problem is I cant create any user It always fails with this same error did you try airflow user list what does it say For this task we are supposed to use PostgreSQL thank you brother No data found Check out this guide  really has that been explicitly instructed UUURA Yes in the challenge intro I did not get that error I first run
airflow webserver
that did not work so I reset my airflow db by using the
airflow reset db
command followed by
airflow standalone then the admin user with the Admin role was already created but I could not know the password that was where I created a new user with a new password and used it to login Yeah what I have done was airflow db init and then create user you used standalone which runs airflow db init airflow create airflow webserver all at once I think that was why you had the password issue previously there goes hrs I will never get back all because not reading the challenge doc
Maybe it would even have been simpler to user Postgres to begin with
anyways thank you UUURA  IMPORTANT

  wsl for you need it to run docker 
 download  or other Linux distro of your choice
 launch ubuntu and youll get a Linux terminal where you can install anything you can follow any installation process that u use in Linux OS it should work
 To install dockerized  Airflow follow  steps this is excellent to see thanks UVHMRPGQ I did but ubuntu installation not successful just ge to your start button on your windows the select Microsoft store and then just type Ubuntu and download free version Okay i will try Thanks UUDRQH where can I find the directory homeekubay the ubuntu folder in my windows OS I want to add my dataset to that directory it worked after a lot of effortbut do not what happened it just worked run this on terminal  explorerexe  what I usually do is open vscode from ubuntu terminal by code  and drag and drop asset I need to use in my project to the vscode folder another option from ubuntu terminal mount windows c drive like this
cd mntcUsersltusernamegtltfolder_you_want_to_mountgt 
and copy the file with cp ltfilenamegt destination UUDRQH thanks in advance I found it UUDFEDHB thanks try this pip install upgrade pip setuptools wheel then pip install dbt I tried it but the same problem UUJGPC help use a virtual environement and see I dont remember exactly but finally I used a virtual env UUFNPEUX I am yet to try dbt I will update you if i got anything UUH yea I try with virtual also but nothing change what happened to the meeting or its me it stopped I think its from the host it cut off not you rejoin Thanks  is it just me or has it stopped yes it did whats wrong rejoin Yes it was ended by the host you can rejoin please rejoin UUURA have you tried this I face the same issue with gcc and this thread helped me
 I have tried that and it wont compile I am trying to resolve lib dependencies I cant join  Youre in  I managed to solve my issue after manually installing all the dependencies If anybody faces the same issue follow the below links
Huge thanks to UUGQV and UUVHCVKB





 Can you try to install dbtcore
pip install dbtcore thats what I did Is it still not working when using dbtcore in virtual env Mine is working UUEJR UUFNPEUX Yes for me also worked but I dont know what is the reason  UUKLBR  yea i did it Its install dbtcore but when i initialize the dbt it raise error Whats the error Can you send a screenshot and have you installed available adapters that you are going to use AttributeError module typing has no attribute OrderedDict UUGNNVB  from the community to the community  Did you install dbt successfully yes dbtcore is installed I am seeing from stackoverflow that this is pythons version problem Can you try to upgrade your python env or use newer version when create conda env UUKLBR Great now it works Thank you a lot UUFNPEUX UUH UUJGPC Thank you UUJGPC can you give me a little brief about the repeated data beyond the ten columns and how can we use them Do you know what session we have at  UTC
The schedule shows two sessions at the same time It is confusing UTEPYRMP I think the Tenx demo session is for tutors I am presently working on the schedule However the tenx demo is not for the trainees  Community building is the session we have at pm UTC Oh  good Thank you so can any one explain to me what is the next step is 
 I download the data as csv
 install and run Airflow
what is the next step UUVHCVKB UUJGPC UUGQV UUURA I think you extract the data and load it onto a database I am also at that stage trying to write the scripts to load the data using psycopg connector so i beleive the first step is to make an a dataframe from your csv data and read your data hence Extractthen you load it to postgres db via pythonoperator from airflow I will do that step with airflow or manually  you extract data manually i suppose but when you populate your db use airflow Have you checked if the pgdb is installed If it is installed That might be caused by the sqlalchemy version I have tried to install it using sudo docker exec aeabef pip install pgdb still no luck What were you trying to do before this error comes I want to store the raw data to the data base Did you write any code in sqlalchemy How did you create the connection engine The connection works fine locally it just has a problem on the airflow which has python  I tried to install it on the containers python but still no luck I suspect a place that a deprecated method is used I dont think that is caused by python Are you having a problem in creating the dockercomposeyamal for airflow ryt yes homeairflowlocallibpythonsitepackagesairflowconfigurationpy FutureWarning The auth_backends setting in api has had airflowapiauthbackendsession added in the running config which is needed by the UI Please update your config before Apache Airflow

Any tips or how should I approach this You can I guess but why What do you get when running the curl engine  create_enginepostgresqlpygresql Do you have an access to this line docker not working on the Or how did you give the host It connected fine the connection string works perfectly I suspect the driver Because the pgdb is lost in the pygresql Okay how about installing the docker extension for vscode  i didnt tried on that Yes I am trying to install that specific module on the docker python Can you remove the driver or can you use another driver That should work okay let me try and  back to you The docker container has more than one python If I find the right one I can do that Is the tutorial session ended yeah yes UUGVFN have u toggled that in the optairflowdagsload_raw_datapy line  What will happen if you remove the pygresql or replace that with other driver Thanks UUDRQH not even open the setting Please make the afternoon tutorial available as soon as possible I was having connection issues and wasnt able to hear clearly UTEPYRMP pray I am trying the second option ubuntu installation and aiflow without docker engine  create_enginepostgresqlpygresqlairflowairflowhostairflow This is line  Yes How do we parse the csv file I dont understand the format Use sep when loading the csv I cant remove pygresql from the connection string I suspect that token and I was thinking that if we replace and if it works we will find a way It will be uploaded as soon as possible I gat you Could you please upload ASAP the video of the tutorial on DBT Its very important I was asleep Thanks sure I will send the link to CUJJLQallbroadcast as soon as possible Thanks very much Will do thank you Let us know when you fix that how  i can make healthy  this error

When I was small my mum told me that if I swallowed chewing gum it will tie my intestines together like a thread

I asked how a baby was born to my cousin she told me when a man and women just sleep together and i asked my cousin how come we dont have a baby then since we slept together she said NOO we gotta be adults and not related haha

My brother used to tell me if I swallowed orange seeds it would grow inside my stomach and the leaves would come out of my mouth and ears This one time I accidentally did and spent the whole night crying

When I was a kid one of my friends told me that I shouldnt eat standing because the food goes down to my leg instead of digesting until grade  I believed it to be true I always ate sitting

Use
docker stop docker ps a q
docker rm docker ps a q
If you want to stop and remove all running containers and dont have a container that you want to keep running                    Has this worked for you It hasnt for me   I received your email about your submission we have received your submission however for subsequent submission kindly note that even if your initial submission is successful if you check again you will see an option to resubmit Its normal and you dont need to worry about that For those looking for switching to Ubuntu    Hello everyone

UTEPYRMP  why google classroom asks me to re submit  I was submitted yesterday but this happened Anyone with such problem Which of your submission please  I would like to confirm if weve received it  Interim GitHub link This might be caused due to various reasons Can you go to the airflow logs to see what has resulted in that state of the container Hello everyone

I really need help Im facing serious problem with the DAG to load the data in the DWH Can you be specific whats the issue youre facing I think Im missing the right way or the process to do it timer_clockSTANDUP IS ONGOING PLEASE JOIN NOW IF YOU HAVENT JOINED YET timer_clock I was trying some codes but not working till now If you can suggest an approach to me Have a look at this article 

There are many approaches you can follow the easiest I can think of would be to write an SQL script that loads the data and just connecting it with a  provided by airflow While you do this make sure to think of how to separate various components like the SQL script to maybe another directory so that if you migrate from postgres and wont use that operator youll have to do the least amount of work Thanks very much 
I will go through the article

I will let you know once I succeed doing it hi guys
what possible data transformations we could make You can do some aggregations like total distance by type something like this or some how a reverse geocoding from latitude and longitude great thankshand  The tutorial on Using DBT and Tableau to build BI Dashboard has started channel Thanks  Does this concern us trainees guys no thanks you are welcome Hello community As I hear this advice from  Academy team and what I have also seen I decided to switch to Ubuntu Linux  I have some fear but I am going to take the risk
and I have some points that I want help with 
 How to I make a soft transition between the OS without losing my data If  it possible to have both of them running one at a time with full hardware capacity just until I got familiar with it
 what is the right Linux distribution 
 does having Linux will make my deceive running doker airflow and the other tools easily  it is core i and  GB ram 
I need you help You can install Linux beside your windows and have both UUH from my experience dual boot is not good unless you have a very performant computer so I wouldnt advice that but if you dont have anything to do with window just erase all But you can save your files on an external drive UUDRQH yes youre right And seeing the capacities of his computer it might be a problem so how this transition should be  you need to back up your files first and I recommend installing Ubuntu I did that transition almost one year ago The beginning might be difficult another option might be using WSL u can enjoy windows and Linux at the same time yes Ubuntu offer a desktop so that its quite easy if you come from wndows but you can even have a windows virtual machine UUDRQH do you mean activating WSL and installing ubunto inside windows if needed UUDRQH do that make my computer run efficiently UUH which one u use  And if you have a low performance computer there is an OS called Parrot OS Home It is really lite and I have used it for over  years And have an equivalent or more performance than the other distros UUJKJGRAQ yeah instead of changing your OS its a smooth transition but not as performant UVHMRPGQ It doesnt it just give u the luxury of using Linux inside of windows machinebut its better than virtualization yes I have WSL but after installing docker and airflow my device become very very slow and it affect my productivity very hard so If Linux nether give me  a better performance than what I have right now it wouldnt be helpful what do you think UUDRQH I want to ask a question connected to Mohammeds
I dont want to switch to ubuntu now
However couple of years ago I installed ubuntu in a virtual machine because I needed to run a complicated semidefinite programming solver face_with_rolling_eyes
I dont remember how resources are allocated to a virtual machine
 is it a good idea to work temporarily for this week challenge inside this virtual machine
 or you advice that I just continue working in my windows environment If you need an ubuntu urgently I suggest you try WSL the programs we are using are CPU intensive and choosing from virtual or WSL WSL works better Ok  thank you UUURA has anyone managed to build dbt dag I am getting dbt command not found error
I am running airflow from dockeri tried pip install dbt in the docker but not working
I also tried dbt operators from airflow_dbt package that yeilds permission denied 

UVLHPDME  Lets just do it well hold each other accountable Im also switching The text is not readable it says the container for service postgres is unhealthy it happens when I try to run docker compose UUGJPC itsits been solved thanks How did you solve that It was a problem caused by postgres attributes in my docker compose file
particularly
postgresdbvolumevarlibpostgresqldata
so I had to create a local folder  with that name reference that in the dockercomposeyaml file and restart the docker compose Im not completely sure of the dbt operator but from a quick overview it seems to only work on  cloud Definitely look more into it Installing dbt within the running airflow container causes lots of issues

Look into  and 

it installs both dbt and airflow before building the image Nice raised_hands Every time I run airflow command my laptop read it like 
Dockercompose kill me  Who managed to connect the dbt and Postgres in a docker container Same rolling_on_the_floor_laughing lol check if there are other containers that are running I do docker container kill docker ps q before i run a new one It kills all the containers that are up in the background I never now that UUGQV  but make sure it is safe for you to do that first How like if you dont want them to be running Great   I will take a look Thank you echo e AIRFLOW_UIDid unAIRFLOW_GID gt env
initailize the docker by runnign
dockercompose up airflowinit  run all the services in the container
dockercompose up  I think you have to create a user other than root try the above command to create the user and initialze ariflow how can I create user Also you should have at least  GB of ram available to run air flow try to search on how to increase it
Because of the resources airflow will run in a loop  I saw you only dedicated  MB   modified that Did it work not yet UUGZJP just follow the above steps particularly echo e AIRFLOW_UIDid unAIRFLOW_GID gt env The webserver is available at  The default account has the login airflow and the password airflow

If youve followed the default dockercompose quick start available  Exactly An ELT Diagram to show how each component is working together Hello channel hope everyone has had a good week Were moving into algorithms for this week and going to focus on Recursion

Recursion is a method of solving a computational problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem It is going to be a significant part of our weekly challenges moving forward so I advise everyone to try their best Resources to get started


 data scientist can do what data engineer do but is reverse ok I dont think data scientists can do everything data engineer can  fact data engineer might have some of the skills data analysts and data scientist can do like data analysis UUURA did you ask about the salary thing on the previous career discussion

i found out this ",0.03136932,0.78844887,0.18018179
2022-09-23,"nan here Q Were the mock interviews useful for those that were listening  Thread your answers here Q How useful would a regular careers QampA session be focussing on postAc employment  Thread your answers  AM
I think of it like this

Kitchens in a restaurant serving hundreds of people
 Data Scientists are the head chefs figuring out the recipes that people want to eat and which fit the budget
 ML Engineers do the cooking for people at scale  They use the ingredients from DEng and the recipes from DSci
 Data Engineers ensure that all the ingredients are coming into the kitchen prepared and ready  No ingredients no food Choosing good quality ingredients and preparing them well is hard
 MLOps folks build and maintain the kitchen infrastructure stoves ovens etc

data scientist can do what data engineer do but is reverse ok
 in random   at  PM   message
 AM The majority of industry will not touch you for a DSci role  they want a PhD  Its not necessarily fair but thats the reality  Dont waste your time going for a Data Scientist role  youll only decrease your interview rate from  to  Morning channel
Reminder  For those that have their on session today please remember to ask the training team the questions you developed from your week  careers exercise Yes it was very helpful I really think so I dont think fresh graduates or still studying students have any idea on what is going out there in the real world when it comes to interviews and landing jobs This will be very helpful listening to someone who have experience in these realm Do you mean postAca training Sorry I did not understand the question I mean QampA about careers not nontechnical assignments I think the end justifies the means right So I think we should have these as many and as rapidly as humanly possible i think it would be really nice especially focusing on post ac employment knowing the pitfalls that are common post ac would really help us prepare for and navigate them i think it would also help to know indicators that lead to a successful career since theres getting a job and then theres _keeping_ a job

it would also really help for the process to not seem as scary or mysterious they were super useful everyone had different approaches to the same questions feedback from all these approaches really helped put in perspective what is important and how to communicate this to the interviewer

id really like there to be more Were going  QA B trainees are now at the point where they are getting timed careers challenges from companies That is actually good right UUGNNVB its good  you guys are ahead of where they were at this point but wanted to emphasize that its not for fun  its real preparation Ohh now I understood why the whole B trainees are mentioned here I really enjoyed the last QA session we had I think it would really be helpful if we can schedule more sessions focusing on careers DAILY STANDUP REMINDERtimer_clock  here UTEPYRMP UUGNNVB

   if you went to enjoy reading about DAGs  use this link  Welcomesmiley   UUEJR did that work for you UUDRQH yes but still am working on the ingesting data i was install the dbtcore on the virtual environment      I was hoping that someone was going to share this exactly thanks oh ure welcome     I was a bit confused in the session do we need to setup a new dockerized envt for redash  You can combine all the services together with airflow dbt but that will really couple things together so having it as a separate service will be the better approach

maybe a faster way to get started shared by Natnael 

Youll still have all of those duplicate services containers and env configurations but It creates this shell script wrapper around things creating a good abstraction if you wanna keep a single compose configuration UTXVNH is it possible to get yesterdays  session videos about  B WD Redash interesting here aws instance is being setup for everyone in a group setup Here is the group list and instruction to connect to the instance using ssh

Group   instances are not up yet  i dont see my name in the list Has anyone managed to setup Airflow Postgres and DBT on Linux out using docker compose
If so what are the steps you took I uninstalled the docker desktop app and installed it using brew after installing Posgresql Now everything is working after  days of  sleepless night What is brew UVHMRPGQ its package management system for mac Ohh thank w do you mean without docker compose Please where can i find my profilesyml files on macos Have you filled the public_ssh_key form I keep getting this error after installing docker and docker compose             Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unixvarrundockersock Is the docker daemon running Have you checked the status of docker Is it running Dont know much about mac but maybe this could help  try troubleshooting using this link  I found it detailed depending on your case Yes without docker compose What we are going to use ssh for can you explain more thank you nardos that works UVHMRPGQ u use  ssh for operating network services securely over an unsecured network its like  your credential for logging into your remote machine to do commandline execution so Academy uses your ssh public key to give you access to aws ec instance and you use your ssh private key to access it since the instance ie your powerful remote machine knows your public key you can connect to it using ur private key pub  priv  conn handshake build  is the one that execute the Docker file right yes
so after you do all these
of course you have to run dockercompose build then dockercompose up d It make sense thanks vm bro sure happy to help UUJGPC How did you get your DBT_PROJECT_DIR location or you can use pwd command to know where you ar at and make your way back to dbt directory

i guess at the start you are at optairflow or sth What seems to be the problem what did it say when you try to install it individually  So this week we have to use it Have managed to install Postgres and Airflow so far but Im clear on how to connect Airflow Postgres and DBT together without the docker compose file Do you want maybe a    minute recap on gmeet may be at least on how to connect the three Sure are you free now yes Ill send you a link  UUJGPC so are you adding your dbt folder as a volume to your dockercompose file yeah yeahunless it wont get permission to access right yeah ure right UUJGPC what about your database which db are you using is your postgresql db run on a container or youre using your host db I think that part is already handled by the airflow image I just accessed it via host name hostdockerinternal i didnt doadd anything to integrate the db I thought hostdockerinternal resolves to the internal IP address used by the host according to  That means youre not using posgresql container that is used by airflow right UUJGPC so where are your tables located can u access them sure you are righthostdockerinternal connects with the host that means 
and my db is not included in the docker you are rightso do I have to change the hostconnection string but if you have installed pgsql on your machine it will work just finegrin I guess so coz weve been told to set it up locally using
fully dockerized that includes our psql being dockerized too Yeah it will if you go ahead and list the tables in your db youll find it I seelet me try that and make it fully dockerizedthanks man where can i find the profilesyml UUJHEQQL CUsersltuser profilegtdbt UUDRQH I just changed the host to postgres  password username and db to airflow and voila its working
thanks for pointing that out UUJGPC  thanks UUKLBR yes i did how do we create a  database table from a dbt source file Are you looking for a way to create a database after transformation how do you make a data bast table from the source yaml file you wrote in DBT an empty table before any transformatin They have an example files inside the folder I saw that but it has only  column if we have several columns do we specify each column inside the SQL file if so then what is the point of the source file My computer is running forever to insert the second table which is large  threads 
host 
port ur port
user airflow
pass airflow
dbname airflow
schema demo how to know my port if you are using PostgreSQL and if you did not changed it manually the default PostgreSQL port is  Yes Im using the db in the airflow container Is the port  Im running but the connection is failing what does it say the error Make sure you made every other configuration the right way Your password is wrong did you change the default password the password is airflow Is the connection successful while you try it in other ways like creating an engine using sqlalchemy just to be sure yes in airflow I used this to load the data
engine  create_enginepostgresqlpsycopgairflowairflowpostgrestrafficdatabase and it worked perfectly  yes the dATA IS NOW IN THE DATABASE may be try postgres on the host part sure and make sure the port is forwarded or else you have to use the internal host address error i thinking about running the docker postgres first like this docker run name somepostgres e POSTGRES_PASSWORDmysecretpassword d p  postgres Are the containers separate  docker run rm P p  e POSTGRES_PASSWORD name pg postgresalpine i dont think that Im running dbt in a container shoud I do that so should put my dbt folder in the airflow onecontainer No if you are running dbt standalone you dont need to put that there Does this one worked for you
 can i use DBeaver as my DBMS I was having issues with postgres and airflow but DBeaver is somewhat not problematic so far And i wanted to know if it can be integrated with dbt and redash UVLHPDME UUKLBR dbt dont have an adapter for DBeaver  I was having a real issue working on postgres too I almost switched to MySQL but what solved all my issue was hosting the postgres db remotely redash dbt airflow are working seamlessly now where did you host the postgresql db there is a platform called railway
 manfacepalmingskintoneI am really struggling with postgres I even uninstalled and reinstalled it but no help is it free Yes there might be limits to it but its freee Thank you UUURA i will give it a go I did not try yet Im looking to how I can change the name and  another option is just to host you db remotely you just have to add your data again but it might solve your issue Use this platform
 I dont know where to start smiley Hello channel are you excited for today challenge
 channel please note to use python for your submissions on the coding challenges sobMy power went out is it possible to do the challenge later UVLHPDME Oh thats too bad The contest has a timer and it will end  after min You can still attempt the challenge on your own later tho okay I will do that Thanks And thats a wrap Hope all of you have attempted the questions and learnt somethings Unfortunately we will not be discussing about the challenge since we have oneonone session scheduled with yall Next week we will have more challenge on these topics and we will have a longer discussion not sure if this discussion is reasonable  they have very different roles I think of it like this

Kitchens in a restaurant serving hundreds of people
 Data Scientists are the head chefs figuring out the recipes that people want to eat and which fit the budget
 ML Engineers do the cooking for people at scale  They use the ingredients from DEng and the recipes from DSci
 Data Engineers ensure that all the ingredients are coming into the kitchen prepared and ready  No ingredients no food Choosing good quality ingredients and preparing them well is hard
 MLOps folks build and maintain the kitchen infrastructure stoves ovens etc The majority of industry will not touch you for a DSci role  they want a PhD  Its not necessarily fair but thats the reality  Dont waste your time going for a Data Scientist role  youll only decrease your interview rate from  to  grains of knowledge but not relevant here I think lets discuss each offer and salary individually and money is only one metric  learning opportunities are also v important  and thats harder to measure Which teams are we supporting in the World Cup Belgium Algeria  England Argentina What a great analogy Thanks UUGNNVB Portugal Senegal Argentina  France Adola muscle Adola without a doubt Adola Adola Senegal  France Senegal Brazil and Portugal Kipchogesunglasses This is not going to be up for debate guys

2022-09-24,"Thanks           hello guys I have installed dbt successfully and I want to connect it to postgres db could any one give me some guidance  Find the profileyml file In that file you can configure the postgres connection In ubuntu that file is located in homeusernamedbtprofileyml what if I created it myself
secondly I have no idea about setup postgres database for both airflow and dbt and maybe for redash could you provide me a good resource where I could follow its steps The profileyml file will be created when you use the dbt init command Have you created your dbt project The database you created for airflow can be used for all  I create a dbt project but the profilesyml didnt come with it and I couldnt connect my database with airflow can you give me steps for that  Try to find a dbt folder in your user directory I found it know should I edit it directly or I should move it to my git repo file  You can edit that directly You can use the same username password and database with the airflow postgres config okay thank you so much UUGJPC dockercompose up airflowinit

 Another amazing thing not related to Autopilot
Go to any of your repositories and press  on your keyboard  What will happen flushed Github will open the whole repo in an editor on the cloud  Go to a file in GitHub or GitLab or Bitbucket
 Replace _ with _githubgithistoryxyz_
and see what happens Thats amazing UUURA and it works  UUURA it works but github copilot is way smart Github has new feature called GitGuardian that will let you know if you have any exposed variables especially API_KEYs DB_PASS UUDRQH What will happen UUDRQH Totally but thats scary at the same time UUGJPC you can quickly browse the history of files in any git repo visually specially helpful to understand large code bases where a lot of people contribute to Those things will replace us and will take our job away We should save some money for the future grin UUURA yeah kinda scary Interesting UUDRQH I dont wanna be replaced with a machine I was hoping we will be the last occupation to be replaced by AI 

UUURA nah Im gonna have to try that before believing sorry haha damn it works   amazing

High Im in healthy UUGJPC I didnt watch the game but thats good news I didnt watch that too I looked the score sheet Yes it is Windows is for secretaries rolling_on_the_floor_laughing Definitely My boss used to say Windows is bad foundation but good marketing rolling_on_the_floor_laughing Yeah he should keep saying that and we on  academy should have cursing session for windows joy rolling_on_the_floor_laughing I would be active participant in that session High Slept extra on the weekend
Low Didnt sleep enough last night                         A very interesting interview with the creator of Algorand      Good morning everyone good morning Good morning Good morning Hello Do you guys have a weekly challenge UUUSMZCZ check on the tenx platform good morning Good morning  good morning thx  I dont have to remove the data from my drive I cant join the meeting can someone help me out I think its am UTC  Which is yet to start Did you join now UUGYHAUT  Yeah Thanks UVVGQG Follow this guide get you started on the environment set up

 No you can keep using windows if its working on your OS Thanks UUKLBR When you are done with the setup You can get familiarized with Algorand by making your first transaction

If you prefer JavaScript follow this guide 
If you prefer Python follow this guide  try sandbox up v the default config setting runs the release configuration I dont understand what exactly is the difference between the two configurations but there is export NETWORK_TEMPLATEimagesalgodDevModeNetworkjson  line added in the dev config I had the same problem and sandbox dev up worked for me and also run it using v which helps more NameError name algod_client is not defined can anyone help me with this error Have you first initialized the algod_client using algodAlgodClient like  algod_clinet  algodAlgodClient  Yes you need to also provide the token and address parameter when initializing it Thank you very much How does one host the algorand network locally what is the exact command UVLHPDME UUKLBR UUDBREG I was struggling to chose between Flask and FastAPI for the back end Which one would you recommend me for this specific project If you have successfully started the sandbox the network will be setup You just need to connect to it You can choose the one that you are comfortable with sandbox up  this is actually running fine but it ends quickly it does not host the sandbox I think I am missing something I am getting
dockererrorsDockerException Error while fetching server API version Connection aborted ConnectionRefusedError Connection refused
errors its an error caused by docker user privileges while I was working on last weeks challenge I just use sudo cmd as a work around but now when running
sandbox up v
I couldnt use sudo can anyone help me run docker in nonroot mode I have searched online and tried to add docker in user group but still it is not working for me why cant you use sudo try sandbox dev up v  or sandbox up dev v and tell me the result UVLHPDME UUKLBR UUDBREG Try giving docker permssion to run with out sudo What are you trying to do exactly here yeah UUDBREG I am having trouble figuring that out
 I have tried adding docker in user group and all but still unable to access it without root  privilege  try using
sandbox up v  thank you that works UVLHPDME UUKLBR UUGQV whats your Linux distro it looks dope UUDRQH its Ubuntu  with a lot of customization yeah it UI looked different whats why I asked I will send you the links if you want when you finally change to Ubuntusweat_smile Does the sandbox takes much time to up  it is taking much time on my end It depends on ur internet connection speed and if it is running for the first time it takes a while to download the images but for the subsequent runs its fast thanks UUDRQH What step did you follow to add groups This is the way it works for me  I have followed this steps  That should work You have changed the USER to your username right yes I did that as well its not working sudo usermod aG docker USER may be try this UUURA I have tried that And this one  If its not working I would uninstall and reinstall it sudo rm usrlocalbindockercompose
This command worked for me But this works if you did install docker with just apt and then tried to install it using another release repo meaning apt repository I used
sudo rm usrlocalbindockercompose
 It seems to be working now

Thanks UUDBREG  UUVHCVKB and UUURA sign a transaction Im having the same problem too Is there any other way to create a transaction without running the sandbox with testnet It could be because it downloads around  blocks Here the code I tried
 I think it will work now I remembered that I use docker in sudo mode So since it needs dockercompose I guess that the problem was with not using sudo Can I do without adding testnet but its running since KIPCHOGE did not win ADOLA let him just kidding by the way Whats Meskel A holiday of finding the True Cross
 How does one celebrate Meskel When is the lemonfestival grin The lemon festival is for epiphany i guess a lot more celebrating with lemons People get their wives in that festival If a man kicks a girl with lemon that means I like you grin  me after  months cold_sweat This pic was really impressive I recommend everyone watching the folm it shows an absolute level pf determination

 Also any one who want to have a quick recap of the all about the sandbox kindly refer to the following


 

get your algos here 

test your algos and your balance here        it works
 

you can follow this also raised_hands   from Yididiya
 
You can use this as a reference when working on your application    This does not open       I found the following resources look worthy


 yes you can use private net which you get if you run ur container with sandbox up and later migrate it to test net and if you test your project thoroughly you can migrate it to the main net UUJNYC I am stuck at this step too Were you able to solve it run the same sandbox up testnet  with the added v argument  so the final command you run becomes sandbox up testnet v so you can get a detailed error log to further investigate add sudo at the begining of the code to solve for the permission error Okay how do i migrate it to testnet then suo sandbox up testnet v UUAKATQ Not yet will retry today Im still getting error host used by another container but Ive tried to stop all the containers and Im still getting an error Please help me solving this how are you trying to stop all the containers I did docker stop container_id try to restart  everything by running the sandbox clean testnet v then sandbox down testnet v  and then sandbox up testnet v tell me the result when this command finishes executing Sure I waiting for it to finish UUVHCVKB its taking time anh UUUSMZCZ I was talking about this maybe you can get the question to your answer here ThanksI was exploring this documentation but I would appreciate it if anyone can help me explain the significance of this steps with this weeks challenge all the signed certificate things I mean all I see here is making some transaction and signing transactionsis it some kind of familiarizing ourselves step or is this really connected to the challenges  im all new to this topic thats why i got confused grin
Thanks UUH Still downloading     just done now But with error host already in use with another container I dont know man I hoped the whole cleaning and rehosting the testnet would have released the container UVLHPDME UUDBREG UUKLBR I know you guys are really busy but maybe if you can take a look at this and provide any feedback it would make a whole lot of difference to me Thanks in advance Yeah May be let me try to reinstall docker and docker compose and clone the repo as a new one and try again UUDBREG UUKLBR UVLHPDME  It might be an internet connection problem Can you try it on a stable connection Can you set a debugging break endpoints to see the output at each endpoints and figure out at which point you are getting the error Can you send the screenshot of your sandbox log file cat sandboxlog the error is coming from line  the send_transaction function That means your private key isnt correct or invalid Can you make sure that you are using the correct private key yeah The private key is the senders private key right It could be connection is actually slow 
I will check it out again and again Try to create a wallet and it will give you a menmonic key From that key get the public and private address and try to go over the previous steps Ive clone a new repo to have a clear log Still need help to setup sandbox You need to free the port Try sudo fuser k tcp Then clear all running containers and try to start the sandbox again clear all running containers like docker rm container Yes You can use docker rm f docker ps a q to remove all containers if there is no container you want to keep running UUGZJP Alright I will do that Follow this guide for the set up I think its working now Thanks very much Its in progress Let me know if it doesnt work Okay I will It works Thanks UUKLBR Thanks UUKLBR Even after funding my account on the faucet I keep getting  Account balance  microAlgos whenever i run my python code this would let me make my first transaction What do I do please ho did you solve this how I am facing the same issue The end of the session Ive started sleeping Please provide the video ASAP Thanks it will be uploaded soon Thanks UTEPYRMP raised_hands No default account or wallet available after setting up sandbox Is it normal Im also having the same problemi would appreciate if anyone could help us Ive dispenser to fund my account but the balance is still  And they I can not complete my first transaction How did you get those account UUVHCVKB I dont have any account in my list Me too And I dont have any wallet or account in sandbox What can I do in what network are you running the sandbox ok I managed to do my first txn but not with local sandbox
I used purestake api UUJNYC and UUH I am soo late but I have fully switched to linux ubuntu what is your advice in regards to the project where I should start  by using this guide and installing sandbox I guess  okay thank you I will do Good to have you on the Linux side of the battle till now I think its good and I am pleased to fight those windows users joy Guys how do you get all the associated accounts of a network using the SDK sandbox goal account list  what is the equivalent of this command using the SDKs are you in the same environment where you installed Of you dont see anything when you run sandbox goal account list  run sandbox goal account new this will help you create an account yes I am having the same issue Its asking to be installed again and again What I did is installed it again works fine at least for now but I need a better solution and may be try with virtual envt You need to fund your account on the faucet Alright I will also go for that then Local But using testnet I did that Many times I did that first Ive got an empty list When I used new to create it doesnt work It says no wallet fund create a wallet with wallet command I did that and it is asking for password to create the wallet and I dont know where to put it So we believe that web  is about power Its about who controls the technologies and applications we use every day  If that is the case how does an entrepreneur in this areaweb  benefit If I am giving more power to the users then how will I profit is that all dry grass That will be a big fire",0.010311817,0.78136295,0.2083252

UUURA UUJGRNE UVVGQG UUH UUFVHFNF UUURA never gets tired of of receiving badges  BADGES IN TWO WEEKS thats impressive kudos to him   this might help    from Yididiya   AlgoSigner Extension          Optin
 UUJGPC thanks for the update Any link to the guide that i can follow sure   We are starting todays standup join now Thank you I was also facing the same problem even if I dispense some algos the testnet doesnt sync I think working with dev instead of testnet solved that  can you elaborate on that  or share how we can work with dev try
sandbox up dev 
instead of
sandbox up testnet and in dev you will find accounts with pre funded algos you can work on them oh ok thank you The main reason for this is the connection you are connecting to you can change the IP address of your connection to the test nets IP address in order to interact with the test nets accounts will try and let you know I am talking about the one you pass as a parameter when you create the algod client the one you pass alnong with the token algod_address  
    algod_token  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
these are the arguments right UUVHCVKB UVVGQG Do you advice then to not use testnet Cause Im having the same issue Should I start sandbox with dev I did use dev but still having the same issue So lets just use purestake alternative Talking about the IP addresses listed under the Servers dropdown in the middle right of the above image Okay let me try it Thanks UUVHCVKB No UUH take a look at this message and all its threads I think it will help solve your problem  You shouldve gotten  starter accounts If you have a good connection start a new dev sandbox and work on that Submodule is the git feature allowing a repository to include another repository with control on the branch of shared repository that is considered by the host repository In order to for your own application to create a submodule associating the shared repositorys main branch do the following
git submodule add b main URL to Git repo 
git submodule init
 Now you can do
git add 
git commit m folder is now a reusable result
git push  Screenshot of the transaction account and asset pages from  that illustrates your exploration of the Algorand sandbox locally 
what does this mean its taken from the challenge document UUKLBR UUDBREG UVLHPDME We need a screenshot of Dapp explorer or algo explorer that shows the different transactions that you have used It might be creating an asset or making a payment to make sure that you have worked with the different available api end points Ok thanks UUKLBR  any ubuntu user who initialise a sandbox successfully  I need help Are you getting an error when starting the sandbox yes and the error is
One or more services failed to start
 Can you send the output of your sandbox log file cat sanboxlog in which directory  i should run this command  it seems that is working now let it finish and I will keep you with the update Try to look into  Api which is an alternative for the sandbox if the error persists sure thank you ERROR composeclimainexit_with_metrics Service indexer failed to build  Build failed UUKLBR it gave me this error Whats the log output Its best to use the purestake api at this point We have covered it on yesterdays session UUKLBR  from where can I get the code you wrote in the tutorial  for the purestake api You can find it on the GDrive Are you able to do other things Does show you any error like the alogo service is not started Did you get starter accounts when you setup the sandbox In the same notebook run pip install pyalgorandsdk if it doesnt run make change pip to pip before importing algosdk

This solved mine 

on how feasible mining cryptocurrencies is i found this podcast episode really useful when i listened to it
in the short term probably feasible if youre not in it solo in the long term probably not since laws are being drafted around this also the return on investment doesnt seem the best neutral_face start with the use case and look for shared benefit for example water is free but there is still a business to be built around
Clean water
Cold water
Water which is ready to drink
Water when you want it
Flavoured water
Water with gas in it
Hot water Thanks UUGNNVB Sharma That is actually a good example So the idea is entrepreneurs should find a way to build a business on this decentralized system  ",0.055508893,0.87834364,0.06614746

Craziest moment at UniversityCollege malestudentmalejudge

Your first date memories Make it more funnygift_heartwomankissman
 Ohh nolaughing There was a conflict one time while I was in university and one of my friend had heart problem She fainted on the ground when she heard shouts and we had to carry her in to some girls dorm through the window UUGJPC n UUURA  did u went AASTU  Funny highschool memory 
At morning assembly students were supposed to sing the national anthem One day the principal threatened to punish any student who doesnt sing  So as you expect no student sang the anthem that day We all had to stand outside for an hour to be scolded for our lack of nationalismwe didnt care because that meant  hour less of lessons Yes I did We once pushed our friend off the school bus bus he had no money to pay for transport then and he had to run to catch it back This is cold but we laughed so hard then Ohh pensivepensive those times very terrifying Nope I am just smiling cause you all went to AASTUgrin I went to kilo the center of FUN We even have the classiest club across the street what about first date memories guys
please share we need to learn how to be romantic grinning We have also the classiest farm land around us grin flushedflushedhow did it go then The gates were officially open til midnight rolling_on_the_floor_laughing and most people dont manage to be there by midnight and a classiest prison UUDRQH theres a movie called Captain Philips Its about pirates who attack a ship ours doesnt have a fence so it doesnt matter You were a good friend smiley Telegram wait let me screenshot itgrin High school
Bought my laptop very late in high school like in the final year of high school late and everyone was talking about it and laughing at me because poor me I am the last one to have a laptop

Uni days
Drinking late at night and jumping into campus only to find the guards knew about our pumping spot and were waiting for us there So funny now but very scary back then

Date
HAHA not in here brothers and sisters not here What were you running from But you guys will go out of Addis immediately especially if you are from country side NowI am the captain now  I heard there were some wild animals there we only had Tortoise and few Monkeys UUDRQH so that means bole is inside of our fence To school UUFNPEUX We gave her some water and she rested for a while She is okay now Nicee UUGJPC u can say that smiley UUGJPC UUDRQH You wish only tuludimtu is inside your fence UUURA there is only rabbits and I think theres also a fox and at night hyaenas in high school our class had to go for mass every monday at noon since it was our day to sing the hymns when we were still new to high school in the first form a couple of friends and i decided it was not that serious so we kept skipping it and hiding in the bathroom when others were leaving for the chapel we got too confident though and then just started staying in the classrooms to sleep instead thats when we were caught

i remember asking the teacher on duty why we had to go if we were gonna sleep anyway she told me shed rather we sleep in the chapel in the arms of the lord that way confessing our sins would be faster

and then we got detentions all of us smiling_face_with_tear Oh  is it because you loved school so much or to avoid punishment for being late sweat_smile on my first dates we watched   movie three or four times UUHAGTR thanks added to my watch list After graduation it was difficult for me to sleep with out hearing the hyaenas roar okay UVHMRPGQ Ill search a movie called Captain Mohammed you dont have to search it come and I will tell you the story I wonder if you feed the hyenas just like in the Harari that might attract some touristsgrinning This might add some enjoyable moments here and there I hope UUDRQH and UUGQV have a recorded hyaenas roar in your phone for sleeping rolling_on_the_floor_laughing I dont think you are talking about the movie Was that in auto loop and you forget that grin you were forgiven in slumberjoy UUGJPC here u go  What Apparently the creator of this video went to AASTU oh I got it that is women writing details in the diary right UUFNPEUX silly me way better  In the diariesgrinning what was the movie tho guess it  The Notebook  Titanic when was it Tell us the title of the movie I will send u if you have GF this may help for beginners   build Dapp     This should help you deal with NFT if you are intending to us JS  Real nice react frontend material

I just dont want to be copying and pasting my PAT each time I do a git push You can use ssh auth UUJKJGRAQ  UUKLBR I ended up using Git Credential Manager as described in  okay I am late to ask u this guysI had issues  the sandbox succesfull run with sandbox up testnet though when i try to run sandbox goal account list  it displays No wallets found Create a new wallet with goal wallet new wallet name then i try to create new wallet sandbox goal wallet new mywallet then it says Please choose a password for wallet mywallet Couldnt read password inappropriate ioctl for device so anyone who experience this error help Thank you UUKLBR Yes I was gonna ask about thatusing DB would make  us use a web  requests right so is there any other alternative Apart from smart contracts or is it a must to use smart contracts I think for exploring through accounts and transactions you no need run testnet Just try sandbox up release Release is a private network version and has some pre created accounts Try that maybe channel
This is a really good thread better to take a look at all the messages written in this thread
 Okay let me try it To add to what UUFNPEUX said you can also use the dev net by running the sandbox up dev v  command or you can use the test net by running the sandbox up test v  command and also remember to use the v  argument in order to get a more descriptive log output to your terminal Could someone guide me to start the frontend development this seems good to initialize at least am watching it  hello all what I did is 
  initiate sandbox successfully thanks to UUKLBR 
 Create and send my first transaction 
 build my first asset successfully 
Now what is next  what should I do next  Thanks UUJHEQQL How did you make your first transaction Using the senders private key or by using a wallet to sign the transaction now sender privet key no  Now try that using the wallet and AlgoSigner If you used the private key try and integrate a wallet next

But if you used a wallet try and implement the trainee optin functionality in order for the trainee to get the asset created

And after you do that create a front and backend and integrate what you have done with them in order for anyone to use it any sources for doing that is it explained in yesterdays tutorial  I didnt understand the term trainee optin UUVHCVKB the wallet part was explained in yesterdays tutorial but here is a very good material you can find everything you need to know here wait a minute let me send it to you I am searching for it thank you UUVHCVKB take your time  I will do thank you pray  Has the tutorial session started yeah just now channel The tutorial has started  Is that Vmmem expected from windows I am having the life of my time using Ubuntu And trust me I would not be lying when I say my compute and memory are very smaller than yours equal if not smaller UUHAGTR yaeah why dont you use purestake api Im thinking about that I think thats better of course my pc has its peace once I started using purestake Here are the things I dont understand though
 I included the hash of a metadatathat could be an image or json in the asset configuration txn   so that token is transferred to the trainee
 how would it prevent forgery then I mean if all of us can generate these assets   
  finally we need a login system for the admins as well right are we going to use algosigner  or myalgo wallet as a login system both for trainees and admins No it is not required to use smart contracts but it would be great if you could have smart contract implementation Try to use a distributed system if you want to go for DB instead of using a nondistributed system which could be a singlepoint of failure and you should be able to show how secure it is because NFT management needs to be very secure Think of other ways that you can share the assetid to the respective trainee that can be secure and wouldnt use much of web tech UUJGPC any resource for purestack api yeah sure  UVNLSU you can get a  github link from their official page link above for each implementation js python or other Im getting error while installing nodejs I looked for different solution but its not working Can I get some help Am not sure why is this issue raised but I suggest you try another version you are trying to install v may be try later version of nodejs Ive tried v And same error msg My be try version       Hi channel please lets use the CTPMJKGallresources channel for sharing resources This channel is for lodging complains related to accessing any of our platforms or other technical issues Thank you What are the topics on todays contest I think its tomorrow UVNLSU  Thanks UVVGQG  I was following tomorrows timetable ",0.052195933,0.7899961,0.15780799

 CLARIFICATION ON LEADERBOARD SCORES

channel Having received a number of complaints or clarity about leaderboard scores its imperative to give a detailed explanation on how leaderboard scores are calculated 

It is essential to note that the following components constitute your leaderboard scores 
 Technical submission 
 Nontechnical submission 
 Standup and tutorial attendance 
 Slack participation 
There are standard scores for each of these components On the leaderboard section of tenx we have week score and previous week score  your week score is the cumulative of all previous weeks including the present week For example the week score  of the week  leaderboard is the cumulative of week to week not week  alone You can also view this example like the grading system of university CGPA Consequently your previous weeks scores will affect all your new scores

my code timed out Hey channel hope everyone has had a great week Today were taking things back and focusing on why so many data structures and algorithms exist We are going back to Run time analysis Runtime analysis allows us to measure how efficient code is Runtime analysis is generally done using BigO notation which represents how fast code will run in the worst case Resources to get you started




 _little secret _ The challenge is going to require some knowledge of the insertion sort algorithm which is simply just a sorting algorithm and so make sure you know how it works and how to implement it before the start of the challenge Resource for the insertion sort sorting algorithm can be found  Sign up for todays challenge  channel

  for those who need it point_up UUDBREG I sent new public ssh_key using the form this is bc I had issues with my os Noted We will update it once every one has submitted UUDBREG I also resubmitted with a new public key because I changed OS since the last one UUDBREG I did the same too  Academy Team

UUGVFN So the final product is going to be a web page that presents some sentence to users and your page should allow users to recordupload audio format of the sentenceyou might deploy it if you want And your application should communicate with your kafka cluster Then apply spark to transform and load your audio data from the kafka cluster

From Gmeet chat  Academy Team response to Genets question
it might help you to get the larger picture of this weeks project QSN Are we building the user application ANS Yes You need an audio input So you create a user application A web page that allows users to upload record an audio file Follow this guide to connect to AWS machine  Just to be clear If Im getting a permission deniedpublic key I should wait till Yabebal fixes the issue right UUDBREG I have also resubmitted the form with my new public key I think soIm having the same error here Or do I need to check my ssh public key I also have the same issue sorry where I could find the sshconfig file
or do I have to make it  you have to create it UVHMRPGQ use nano to create edit and save it by mkdir sshconfig  right  you can also do that if I am not wrong is nano a text editor  yes I think nano is a text editor just like gedit can anyone share the form that we are going to submit our public key  I will try to install it how can i get this IdentityFile ltCHANGE path your your private keygt  I mean what is supposed to be inserted there it should be located in the ssh directoryusually sshname of file containing pk If on Linux system sshid_rsa  like this Its the same I think If the folder was created in the home dir Not the public key Omit the pub this is your public key
your private key doesnt have an extension so yours would be sshid_rsa got it I am still getting permission denied publickey Should I wait the same here UUJGPC I didnt get you my puplic and privet key are stored in ppk file in the home directory when I link to that it give me error sshid_rs  does this work for all ubuntu users  i was trying to tell Thamar that id_rsapub is a public key filethe private key doesnt have a pub extension I am not sure with ubuntu users
PS it doesnt necessarily have to be id_rsathis should depend on the name you gave your file at the time of key generation I am able to connect to the server through ssh But when I try to open jupyter notebook in my browser it keps saying channel  open failed connect failed Connection refused I have installed and uninstalled wget several times but when I run it its telling me its not an operable program what could be the reason Host g User degaga_wolde HostName  StrictHostKeyChecking no IdentityFile keysid_rsa LocalForward  

is there anything wring in this command line i am getting an error wget  The link also on downloading the tar file is not valid has anyone managed to do that I am restarting the all aws machines once they are up everything should work accordingly ssh connect to host  port  Operation timed out  the ssh is on but still get this error when running the  ssh g The machines will be up in mins afterthat almost everything should be working USE THIS THREAD to report if you are unable to login or something not working after about mins Ok Different error port forwarding is disabled I changed my ssh from last week Same error you will find knownhost file in the ssh directory
open that and delete the fingerprint of the previous  academy key you can delete actually known_hosts file the whole but your error may be that private key is not valid  make sure you set permission to  the ssh folder should have  permission do the following

chmod  sshid_rsa
chmod  ssh UUJGPC same here after i delete known_hosts use sudo I think it is a permission error from the os right I dont know The second line after the error tho rolling_on_the_floor_laughing Same here delete the known_hosts file Yeah its working now Thanks UUJGPC Is anybodys jupyterhub working I cant login even if I have used the stated username and password Same here which part should I delete I cant get the fingerprint UUJGPC Has anyone logged in on windows just delete known_hosts from ssh directorybut if academys finger print is not registered this process wouldnt be necessary UUJGPC but it replaced again me too Did you manage to login are you using window Im also facing permission denied error im looking for solutions not yet no I need help I did UUGZJP still the problem stands Im getting server refused our key error when trying to login using putty on windows UUJKJGRAQ I also facing the same I thought it is only macos which is denying changing file privileges I am trying to solve the issue Any solution I havent figured out anything yet Okay We should announce each other if we get anything rm rf sshknown_hosts  but the permission issue still Yes
 and have you had any luck activating environment  yes no difference Same here Any solution so far Im still getting a permission denied error UUKLBR many of us in group  have lost the private key because we were updatingchanging the os is it possible to reconfigure the instances given for us because we are getting permission denied error while trying to connect with the new private key Are you using putty Did you miss the chmod commands in the guide oops what chmod command UUURA chmod  sshid_rsa
chmod  ssh this two I did not even read that section I thought it was only for windows users But it was already like that for both the folder and the private key file cry Yes and bash too do you want me to restart the instance so that the original ssh key is copied or do you want something else UUUNMRX I lost the ssh key I entered on the form last week However I recently added a fresh ssh key to the Google form I received a permission deniedpublickey problem when attempting to log in with the new ssh key I believe it is taking happening because I am attempting to utilize the ssh key I produced today after losing the original key used to set up the instances Is it feasible to utilize the current one UUJKJGRAQ UUGZJP delete the knownhosts file if the problem is persisting credit to UUJGPC  Nice How did you stumble up on this particular video man here Hello everyone can you drop your git username I want to add you to an organization Hello

adijat_ojutomori Thank you that works I need help please UUUNMRX  UUKLBR the instance we are using is EC right I created a folder using the terminal then cloned a repo inside it How do i open the folder on the jupyter gui so i can create a notebook inside that very folder typing jupyter notebook in the desired folder does not work I loged to my instance but I cannot log in into my notebook which username and password did you use Use the same username and n as pass it says u are not in the sudoers file is it bc am not sudoroot leader Yes I have connected with the aws machine but I cant access jupyterhub ok UUURA got it Thank you  the problem wasnt from that it was from the knownhosts file  Are we going to have to install everything starting from programing environments to airflow kafka dbs    on the AWS instances run this command ssh i sshid_rsa mailtoemtinan_salaheldingacademyorgemtinan_salaheldingacademyorg  and see if it can work I guess UUDBREG   has the answer I hope so lets wait for her How are voices going to be produced to topics Are we supposed to build the model in this project what model are you referring to if youre referring to ML model No we dont  How do I find my jupyter notebook file in my instanceusing the terminal

UUKLBR UVLHPDME cd and ls lraiare going to be your friend brother mntsfscacheacbatchnotebooksltyour username gt mntacbatchnotebooksltusernaegtsomefileipynb what is this UUURA i think its better if you use the vs code envt UUURA is this where the notebooks saved UUVHCVKB Location of the notebooks UUDRQH Yes yeah youre right I found it thanks UUURA how do I open my own file inside juypyter notebook  What do you mean by new file like py file when you connect to the remote machine youre we at homeltusernamegt right so if we create a new project folder  lets say at mkdir homeandenet_alexanderprojectA how can wee loadmount this folder inside of juypter notebook I have the same question UUJNYC have u figured it out  I have the same problem point_down but why do you want to mount that to the jupyter notebook directory UUDRQH to create to create a notebook file and edit it at the same time manage the version with git n all that jazz UUDRQH you can only execute notebooks inside the jupyter hub  you can open and edit the file using vscode but you cant run it on vscode cant you use vscode for that UUDRQH UUURA oh i see thanks UUURA Im using vscode but vscode requires a kernal to be installed inorder for it to open execute ipynb so I was hoping to edit the notebooks on jupyter hub but I think I cant do that If you want to access the file you can just press ctrlo on vscode and navigate to the file
UUDRQH an other approach for tracking the file is moving your project to the jupyter hub so the only option I have is create the notebooks on jupyter hub and movecopy it to my project dir when Im done nope i think you can connect to a jupyter server from vscode Yes if you dont want to move your project there yes how do I connect UUJGPC How I would really like to know i think that would workbut what was the command to get the jupyter server running Yes I have tried that but I couldnt get all the envs listed as yours same I think after installing the python extension it would work yes i thinks so It keeps failing on my side tho UUJGPC I am having DataScience error grinjoyrolling_on_the_floor_laughing
DataScience Error Error Failed to install the Python Extension haha lol I have no idea beyond this for real Yea even my vscode got confused man it just installed for me with no error but how do i get the url for the jupyter server any idea  this is the url right when I insert that it prompted me use enter user name and password but it says the password is incorrect the password is n yeah I tried that but didnt work for me I thought the  was a terminal indicator hv u tried it and I kept trying only n yeah same error for me too UUVHCVKB my deepest condolences joy UUJGPC yes my pc is going to shutdown  cry there is a power outage im going to shutdown exploding_headthere is a sleep outage joy I think if you are trying it on vscode I dont think the URI is the correct one not really sure tho its an http username and password credential is not accepted by the instances let me know If u figure it out now it is  How did you get the server URI my vscode tozalech man Is all the work involved in the weeks project going to happen inside AWS UUUNMRX UUFNPEUX Ive deleted the knownhosts file But Im now getting permission denied error public key same here I think But it seems that if you want to work on your local machine its also okay Same here also the error message seems to change when I run the ssh g command with and without sudo UUVHCVKB I think you cant use sudo commands in the remote machine unless youre a group leader each group has only one person with root access to the machine UUDRQH see the image first I am not using sudo on the AWS instance Im using sudo on my machine when I run the ssh command Are you talking about that same UUVHCVKB Oh I see yeah its strange UUKLBR UVLHPDME UUUNMRX Please help us to connect to the machine UUKLBR UVLHPDME UUUNMRX Please help us to connect to the machine  zipper_mouth_face    The pilot batch seems fun and more interactive Yes you are right my mistake lets just have the meeting after the first tutorial before the career tutorial Which means between  and  Todays schedule is just hectic what can we do here What about after the last tutorial of the day Yes that sounds great UUUPMDF I think well all have access to the AWS instance by then Hopefully Sure Hey channel How many of you have managed to connect to the instance not me not me too I havent ah cool can UUGHTV UUJVFZ and UUUPMDF send your public keys here sshrsa 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 chuchuchuchuPORTEGER sshrsa AAAABNzaCycEAAAADAQABAAABgQDtcLegfFHopqWlYJDhCtRQGHARzfuNEKpcSrmqSXVLsyBgLOfjWVbLUkcfAWSodZiTOfpvkuoqoLnzmVWHENHpNOBzOmYrTYbJFhrRabjQPtfkBcQnNdmlvNsWURqpeBthEUEWMpdeFnHBLjFHhfyuVxHjUBPsmPzWhiqaGIbkwhbNnYTOtdHKFekcunwnhjxSqIKmucsZDyHwYzyzTJZQDLARHtalaYPMsdUijAqcCDvVcUszMmLkMzpCMCeriOuNQZhWCmlzOCmhGpBBTSPFotqDqoejsdpUfZoOpLQJrDvkHXSCnquYfcvQKVYVNhfTtGOMbBulWGBykOihIzFvXWsVgthiTKNLWEJmWSAXauZjOuChfiEtclGCYLJdhqkQHVDXoXPlqFskQbXxVNQSqXHRbimQPKIdgplLs try it now can you try it now UUUPMDF is it working for you can i see the config file No its the same as before same here whats the permission on your private key  Verify the permissions on the id_rsa private key are private rw

Tuesday October     pm
Google Meet joining info
Video call link  Meeting started please join sorry guys I am currently unable to attend the meeting Its working now thank you UUURA can you show me how to connect to the instance using vscode ssh i ltpath to ur keygt mailtogedion_abebegacademyorggedion_abebegacademyorg  You can follow this link too after you run the command a config file will be created anyone been able to run airflow or kafka in the remote instance Im getting permission denied error you were able to login right before that Yes using putty UUUPMDF have you created the config file Yes is ltpath to ur keygt the private key if you created a config file you can use that to connect using vs code yes dont use pub okay I think if you installed remote explorer when you open vscode it will ask you to connect to the remote instance On the remote explorer there is SSH Targets and you can find your config there I have remote explorer installed and  does show up under ssh targets so are you still unable to connect is the identity file location correct Yes it is Host g

   StrictHostKeyChecking no
   IdentityFile sshid_rsa
   LocalForward  
anyways this is how mine looks try the command you used in vscode in putty the ssh i command You just use the UI in putty there isnt a cli do you have git bash Yes Ill try it on git bash OK and when you successfully log in using git bash try that particular command while connecting to a host on vscode Is your private key file a ppk file 
Im getting an invalid format error mine has no extension No its not but am not sure about  windows the public key has pub but the private one doesnt have any extension Maybe its cause Im on Windows I think Im in thank you guys What should I do next Did you connect to the jupyterhub   Im trying it now UVVGQG Did you manage to perform EDA using the jupyter hub Yes UUURA I have tried to explore the data a bit  Im in jupyterhub Using pandas How did you change the directory What do you mean   I downloaded the git file using wget and extracted the zip file and load that into pandas  I couldnt install pandas on it so I was trying to change the directory to the env which have pandas in it I used pip install pandas  I will try that Have you tried phthonipykernel   How did you save the notebook into your repo Yes that was the one I tried it didnt have the pands package but now its working I think you installing it fixed the issue Still working on that UUUPMDF  Try copying and pasting the ipynb file after you are done with the EDA part UUURA so that means any install I perform in my account also affects you guys Yes create env for the other part I just created a new ipynb file inside my eda directory Any ideas on how to create the js tags   This article has nice explanation for it Has anyone push the data into the repo so I can pull it should we use dvc That would be good I am working on setting up airflow and kafka can you guys do that I can do that Let us know and give us instruction afterwards I am unable to install dvc i thing pip requires sudo privileges UUURA Let me try to create a global env then ok source homemain_envbinactivate UVVGQG can you activate it  If you can activate it I can install dvc is it a conda environment or a python its just python i dont have the permission Error Errno  Permission denied homemain_envbininclude I tried
python m venv homemain_envbinactivate source homemain_envbinactivate what about this one yeah I am in main_env now pip is also working its better if you install the requirements by adding a requirementstxt or an environment file pip install works for you yes it does in the main_env Try pip install dvc and let me know the out put in the main_env ERROR Could not install packages due to an EnvironmentError Errno  No space left on device it starts then when it reaches the end it returns this error Mine is very different error from this one Its a wheel build error have you tried sudo Yes it required sudo its an other error let me send it Its a libdev error let me try to fix and get back to you UVVGQG It perfectly installed on the jupyter hub source optminicondabinactivate here is the jupyters hub environment I think everybody is authorized to use that UVVGQG You can proceed now Just to be clear we all going to do some eda right Yes but before that we were going to use versioning on the data so we can use the same version using dvc So how do i access this version we agreed to use Also its a big data are we using all of it or samples or batches UVVGQG is setting that up he will give us instruction Okay Should we do some of the eda on our local machine until dvc is set up and then we can just copy the code once everything is ready Yes that is better ok thanks but be careful I think the jupyter miniconda env is for everybody in every group So I was getting No space left error in the directory Yea me too I am waiting for Azarias response You couldnt even store MB sure I only installed dvc yes the file is only  Mb file I am stuck on that error too I couldnt proceed on the Airflow part what should we do any response from azaria No response yet Lets just continue locally til we here from him Im getting the same error That is great I think we should rearrange the time though If Im not mistaken from PM to PM we have career tutorial right",0.021313328,0.8835772,0.09510943

 I love such analogies   MVC with nice explanation with examples
  same    to read more more papers about text to speech   Anyone successfully created topics on kafka No I havent the potential solution my group came up with is to ssh in to the instance on vscode that way you can work on the files that are on the instance right there in vscode

But UVVGQG  was facing the problem of no space left when he tries to load the data Run this on vs code terminal ssh i ltfile path to ur private keygt mailtoadijat_ojutomorigacademyorgadijat_ojutomorigacademyorg 

Change the X info to yours You also need to install one or two extensions from vs code marketplace More info here
 got this error when i tried to log into the jupyter hub Warning JupyterHub seems to be served over an unsecured HTTP connection We strongly recommend enabling HTTPS for JupyterHub any idea how to solve this I am not accessing the jupyterhub UUDBREG I connect it with this ssh i homeekubayMykey  mailtoakubazgi_gebremariamgacademyorgakubazgi_gebremariamgacademyorg   if i go with ssh g it says permission denied So how do we generate speech from the audio using libraries how do we generate speech from the audio using libraries Whats the role of the data provided in the generation of text from speech may be initiate your terminal tried that still the same we are not generating any thingwe ask users to record voice notes for the text the have been provided and we are supposed to return a text right you will provide a text for the user and the user should record his voice reading the text in the Amharic language which group are you group  and we are also facing storage error in the aws instance it returns

 Already what did you install only dvc and pandas okay let me check I have increased all instances memory you might have experienced a glitch forced log out but it should now be working channel the msk kafka cluster is ready
Two brokers are available and your bootstrap servers are


You can create a connection to this cluster within your allocated EC instance When you create a topic make sure to append your group name to that topic so different groups works dont collide

Example topic
      gtopicName

Use this thread if youre facing any issues connecting with the cluster no you collect voice file from an applicationweb application for the text you provided for that user so that you can later use it to train your model I think this project will continue for beyond this week for the ML part UUDBREG should we install Airflow or are you going to install it It wasnt clear Its like localhost is not accessible How to have access to the airflow dashboard when its running in the instance The tutorial starts in a few minutes
 Group  instance Jupyterhub is now working  let me know if you have any issue same here Same here There are others who have already installed so you go ahead and install Same error in group  check it now it should work Group  jupyter hub is now working it should work for everyone Its still not working Group  I am having the same issue same issue same here it is working now thanks UUUNMRX g not able to access jupyterhub spawn failed Same here for g I think it is going to be used to prompt the users in order for them to record the respective sound Urgent Im trying to connect to dvc remote in my drive from the ec machine I use the link but it ends with an error How can I proceed how I could transfer files from local machine to ec instance  not sure but you can use the scp command i tried to use it but it gives me connection time out scp local_data_path  remote_data_path  is kind of the formt I guess is the data big no it is less than  mb I think  kb  That is the only command I know or you can also use github push it from your local machine and pull it within the AWS instance but I dont think that is a good way of solving this difficulty no it worked I was writing the command wrong Thank you UUVHCVKB This one is fixed All group machines should now be working as expected including Jupyterhub Let me know if it is not Yes Thank you  Those who have root access please dont reboot machines for any reason Let me know if you require rebooting  UUKLBR could you please share kafka tutorial slides  UVLHPDME do we edit this on serverproperties config file on broker id                           How do we create a connection to the clusters youve created            How can everyone else from the group connect to the cluster  Also wht command do we run to check the cluster status Its been added to GDrive Lets think about itthinking_facethinking_facethinking_face
  betam new mimechegn ehe sew Yeaa besmam I wish I was thought physics by him    sorry guys for the late replay i was tited with other issues and i do no from where i am going to start is there anyone who canbrief what i am going to do We are having issue setting up the instance properly so now weve resolve to doing it locally till we hear from the tutors can some one walk me throught the configuration step i am way back is it a network problem i dont think so I am able to clone this into a new directory maybe if there is a typo try this
git clone   but when it says this it is mostly a network or connection problem yea i have got company antivirus installed and it isnt allowing wsl to connect i am guessing it works fine on my windows though but i got airflow setup on the wsl UUJVFZ same here It happened today I was just working fine yesterday Yeah yesterday it was fine does ssh g work for you and are you able to access jupyterhub guys has anyone been able to push to the github repo not yet do we have remote dvc how are we dealing with the data any idea we are having a storage issue it says
No space left on device
when trying to load the data guys I have updated the readme file you can edit your personal contacts information the order is based on the challenge documents group table The instance is giving us a lot of issues so well do the eda on our local machine Its supposed to be i  ltyour ssh keygt not the path The path to your ssh key thats what i did Join before  minutes laughingsmile

Is the problem with aws instance fixed now guys are you still facing issues connecting with the instance UVVGQG I have connected to the instance but the space issue is still there UUJVFZ for the local instance you can download and start working on it The dvc is hard to setup now Im getting
ssh connect to host  port  Connection refused
error Maybe its a connection issue yeah I am in now here the instance is working now for me yea yes same here same Same here Ok should we create a notebooks folder for the eda file Yes The Storage issue is fixed the error is still persisting on my side storage That is still the same for me Airflow is up and running The topics could be the classification labels in the test dataset There are four main categories like politics country specific  So every consumer and producer we will use these topics I think the report can be done after AM UTC but until then can we all focus on the technicals   Yea thats a great idea So the airflow server is up and running and some of us can work on the kafka section  generating topics and writing scripts to initialize a backend api 

And the rest can work on setting up the airflow and creating dags to manage the kafka   I will work on kafka section  generating topics and writing scripts to initialize a backend api I will try to work on the airflow dags  But we also need to translate the topics categories in the dataset before publishing the topics  What do you mean by translate They are written in amharic  Is there a way to handle that   I dont think we need to translate those so can we create the topics in Amharic  and consumers can subscribe to that We can simply rename the category column before using the dataset But the content of the articles remains in Amharic yeah thats what I was saying Ok translating them makes sense I guess So our topics are as follows
national_news
sport
politics
international_news
business
entertainment Yeah thats good So in order to not confuse with other groups we will append g in the front skintone Yes definitely guys my wsl is refusing connecting to the internet AM UTC yeah PM EAT I was confused by the AM thank you for the clarification here can you guys confirm if you can run the below command
source activate g_env Yes I can access it UUURA  good job skintone  I am working on creating dags so should I create them in the same directory as the directory the dockercompose is running UUURA  The docker dags are running inside my dir let move it to home and re run it Youre already logged in Yeah Thats good I think we should also have a directory in home that clones the git repo so we can all work within our branches there Yes Youre already in the instance That would cause a lot of problem since we are going to have one git file so when we check out for a branch it might change somebody elses branch Do we share a common directory  i cant do this though Use port forwarding Ok that makes sense UUURA 

Yes UUUPMDF I think its a shared space I can navigate to your folder and also to home  You can navigate but I dont think you can read the contents Ok so if the airflow dags directory is going to be our home how can we track the code using git I can also do that grin try it UUURA  I was trying that on notebooks and it failed upside_down_face Yeah thats my question  Can we have a quick call on this issues and It can be like a quick status check Sure Yeah  can somebody set up a call my calendar is not working We can just use the previous link OK lets join I think its a connection issue its a connection issue if youre using windows with WSL you are likely to get that error yes i am using wsl on windows UVVGQG ariflow is in home dir now let me know if you face any permission issue sure so we are using the miniconda environment right the installation fails on that too grin what should we do then what does it say youve tried sudo right I was just trying it on my local to test UUUPMDF theory but its returning kafkaerrorsNoBrokersAvailable NoBrokersAvailable Same here UUURA since its not running on the instance its not working but I think if we set up kafka using the docker compose and run it on our instance and use port forwarding it might work Its working now I was trying to work using confulents kafka package On the instance its giving me an error when trying to cp files into the airflow directory UUURA its a permission denied error UUUPMDF yes I tried pip install kafkapython its seems to be working UVVGQG Let me fix that real quick On the mini conda UVVGQG is it working UUUPMDF No No just our groups python That good right We can procced Yeas thats the best news so far Yididiyas response about the S bucket Can we use the same environment as well UUUPMDF The nd best news so far Yeah thank god Yes I have installed pip on it so try pip freeze and send me the output let me check it with what I have Ive created a requirementtxt inside my directory can you access it Let me check UVVGQG You are the one who shuts down the airflow right yes I was working on the dags its up and running now OK When I see it down I just wanted to check Can you add kafka as a dependency in the docker file how Its the same so we all can access it Not sure maybe how airflow depends on postgres and redis Can we pip install on our own now try this command
pip install kafkapython Great it worked NICE Its missing a python package Is it kafkapython Yes how can we insert a requirement file and install it in docker thats the part I dont understand and yeah its a kafkapython problem Try it now the package is installed still the same if you installed the package in the local environment it wont work you have to install it in the docker compose Try it now same I just installed it inside the container can you check if the dags section still contains an error in the airflow dashboard There arent any dags yes but there is an error right Yes Can you restart the container so that means its not from my side the kafka module hasnt been installed in the container Am trying to install it as an additional requirements UUURA its saying permission error as I try to edit dag scripts UVVGQG Try It now here I have added a first draft of our approach for implementing the project feel free to make changes UUUPMDF On this doc Yes A Pdf report with an overview of your approach including a detailed diagram The report should For the diagram Lets use the diagram on the githubs readme Sure I have found a way around it its now working How did you solve it man How did you do it its a very bad method grin I run the container in exec mode and installed the package manually

it is working now but we will find the right way for the final submission I did try that the first time you and it wasnt workingsweat_smile
The right way might be PIP_ADDITIONAL_REQUIREMENTS _PIP_ADDITIONAL_REQUIREMENTS kafkapython In the compose file It should work but I tried it and it didnt smiley yeah the right way doesnt work when you want it laughing  Is there any transformation made on the audio file apart from checking for blank files of course before dumping it in the s bucket sweat_smile I dont think so okay thank you So the s bucket in this project is a data lake UUURA did you take a look at the explain your approach part of the report Yes I am adding few points on that Ok great guys what does it mean a picture for your kafka cluster and I have also created the topics and taken a screenshot UUJVFZ are u there UVVGQG Please what tasks are in the dag you created Yes I am UUGHTV can u share ur piece on the google doc Its a single task that performs topic reading by accessing kafka  UUJNYC  Okay thank you Sure Ive had some ideas UUGHTV UUJNYC and UUJVFZ please try to update your profiles in the git readme file or perform some activity I think participation is also considered in the grading We will Im wrapping up my report UUUPMDF I have added some topics on the doc here Please confirm when you are done with your part so we can compile and submit on time The think there are two lists which one did you edit I combined yours with mine and added it in the top of the shared doc The one under Approach Overview Yes thats what I have added and also the business understanding one Ok thank you I am having an electric issue my pc just died  I will not be adding more on my topic sorry  What was your topic UVVGQG Spark I think we can finalize the approach overview if you dont have anything to add Yea I didnt find much so we finalize on what we have Ive also added some spark material Niceee Im done with my part I am compiling the final document so if any body want to use it Just to clear something up its text to speech right Sure Yes Yes",0.009515456,0.41055563,0.57992893

 Thanks joy joyjoyjoyjoy Our debate was gender debate joy smiley was great UVVGQG I wrote down some quick ideas for debate topics in a file I will share it with you We can use the file to add more ideas and improve on them I was wondering what if you realize you are on the wrong side in the middle of a debate say a real life debate  youll obviously accept the fact that you were wrong ha so  having a flexible point of view is also good practicethinking_face these two skills are quite opposing right DAILY STANDUP REMINDERtimer_clock

No need to create or manage any cluster

Everyone has access to the cluster That is why we have said to append your group name to the topics you create so topics from different groups dont overlap UUKLBR how can I make the environment I created as a root user to the other group members For example when I install airflow it is only me who could access it The others are unable to access and use it I want the ho up members to access it How could I do that You can create the environment in the home directory where all members can access it the type of envronment we create for our python modules when starting a new project  something like that or exactly that type of environment Yes it can be the type of environment we create for our python modules when starting a new project The spark connection notebook used in todays tutorial by Natanan has been added to the weeks folder You can access it using this link   A THOUGHT FOR TODAY

 Please signup for the timed contest   Hi UUKLBR  I think UUFVHFNF is out of network at this time he text me SMS message that he is unable to work the timed contest he told me to inform you on behalf of him  Thanks Thanks UUJHEQQL okay back good I always face the problem of my idea of solving the challenge is right but the code do not give the needed output and I run out of time smiling_face_with_tear UUDRQH Thanks for sharing that git history thingygrin It helped me today heheheavy_check_mark UUJGPC Im glad it helped saluting_face Alright noted Thank you here UUGHTV and UUUMRQ meeting has started UUGHTV we waiting for you So we dont have a shared bucket for the whole group well each have a bucket UUUPMDF ask Yididya about your concern UUURA is flask installed on our instance here I am not finding any reference that talks about sparks application in audio processing have you found one its not installed are you using g_env No I have installed it inside g_env try it Should I activate g_env yes I think most of the packages are installed inside g_env  g_envbinactivate this is the proper command right
Cause its giving me a g_envbinactivate No such file or directory error conda activate g_env try this one conda command not found Im in the repo directory Its working for me

have you tried to I install flask in the base base this one source optminicondabinactivate its been already installed in the base I just checked So should I continue using the miniconda environment its better if you could move to g_env What is the path to g_env can you try source activate g_env Im in thank you youre welcome  Just generate a token on git and use that as a password Its was some tedious setting issue but its work now The only processing required is to check for a noise and use some Model to check for the accuracy of the audio by converting it back to text and scoring it Lets just focus on this two for now While I have you here I had some questions about the api implementation If we have multiple producers for all our topics should I create multiple api ends for all the consumers Yes or I can pass a topic while making the request and you can consume based on that You can pick the feasible and easier one to implement I was thinking of randomizing the topics For the initial part that I will request to right Every time you make a get text request the api will send you a message randomly selected from one of the topics Can you send me all the endpoints including request body too Sorry for the delay the power was out Ill get it to you as soon as possible No problem man send me when you can  get_text this will send the frontend the following data headline category article
 get_audio this will request the following data from the frontend headline article json_id audio_file I will use this thread if I faced any issues get_text will send data randomly selected from our topics so some topics might not have any messages initially
And you need to create a gaudiooutput topic to test the audio output endpoint the category is it the mapped one Its the original one OK but what is the endpoint to apply the audio get_audio is used to fetch the audio How about for uploading the audio Yes its used to upload the audio file so get_audio has both get and post upload audio and fetch the uploaded ones No it  only uploads the audio file and sends the path using a producer OK thanks man I will let you know the progress No problem What is the port number   Like this I am getting connection refused error yes Its a GET request I am getting timeout error Have you received the request It might be because of the consumer I dont think all the topics have messages and since its random you might not get any messages so you need to make sure all the topics have messages Run the text_producerpy script a couple of times thats the text producer Yea may be its taking a while to load I am trying it in a browser so it wont throw timeout but its taking like too long I even finished  of a song esun eyetebeku Did you run the text_producerpy No No Run the text_producerpy script a couple of times thats the text producer where is the location producertext_producerpy the absolute location I havent pulled any updates from the git yet texttospeechdatacollectionproducertext_producerpy How are you running the code if you havent pulled yet If you run the API I can just forward the port in my vscode I will let you know the progress I am having connection issue Ok Its still not working I have ran text_producerpy like  or  times AttributeError KafkaConsumer object has no attribute value Have you faced this error Ill check it on my end
 Can you check if there are any messages in our topics Let me check Can you add this message  consumervalue on line  in the apipy file Let me know if it works TypeError KafkaConsumer object is not subscriptable now this error happened On what line message  consumervalue  on this line for message in consumer
            message  messagevalue
            return jsonify

                article messagearticle Try this one line  you mean a transcribing model Do you think we can find transcribing model that performs well on Amharic language We might not find one but this was what yabebal suggested when I ask this question on a session ok I will take a look Lets try to look for a good model if we are successful nice if not we will just apply some noise check and the noise check can only be implemented in other python packages and not on spark I couldnt find a resource that uses spark to do that Now the for loop is taking forever Yes some other package Did you check if there are any messages in the topics There are none I think I even tried to give the topic manually which was produced It didnt work when you manually produced a message I produced it randomly but I tried to consume the randomly produced topic Did you use the text_producerpy or did you do it yourself Can you consume the ones youve produced I used text_producerpy Thats what I was trying So the producer isnt the problem we can narrow it down  to the consumer
set the topic variable on line  to ginternational_news since we know there is a message in that topic Yes but it is still returning nothing chrash Its crashing now just froze in the for loop Can you try to print the consumer alone to see if were actually getting the message I tried that but its printed as an object for message in consumer
            printmessage message  messagevalue it freezes here No just
for message in consumer
            printmessage printmessage

 Is there a way to check our messages using cli as you can see it only prints Yes there is but we have to install kafka first Let me install it manually first What about printing the produced messages If its from the cli we need kafka installed No print using the python sdk I think thats consuming Alright Ill just try to debug it from my end and you try  to install kafka ANY LUCK  No not yet I even created a new topic thinking it was either our topic or the producer that was the problem but the producer is working just fine its the consumer thats the problem How about you I installed kafka and all And I have been playing around the consumer is working correctly like the freezing in the for loop was correct its waiting for a topic to be produced What still annoying me is the producer part I couldnt get it to work Wait the consumer code is working import os
import json
from kafka import KafkaConsumer KafkaProducer

         producersendtopic valuetransaction
        printtopic transaction this code works fine What about the producer code but the producer code for some reason is not working like we have a huge logical error Whats the error The consumer code works fine like when I produce using the cli the above consumer code works fine it waits for a message The producer is working fine on my end and the error is logical meaning we might made a mistake somewhere it compiles successfully but for some reason its not working How did you know it is producing if you cant consume malete ke cli produce sareg ene the same topic it works fine the consumer gets the message  but not from the code seems to be working If its returning a metadata then it means its working How did you return the metadata let me try it add gettimeout at the end on the send function yes producersendgettimeout Now the consumer works on my side it gets the message Seriously With the same code Yea this code  What is it printing out byte values of the news so I was thinking rather than trying to consume for every get_text request lets just send the random data to the frontend and after I send it back to you lets just do the producing there and the spark will consume those what do you think Can you uncomment the value_deserializer itll convert it to json But if its working now shouldnt we just stick with it We can gn it waits forever if its not produced after I make the request It has to be produced after I make the request and by the way the byte is converted now to the initial json or lets look for a param that we can pass to get all the streamed messages and we just pick the last one Ok what was the problem then You used the same code right just this gettimeout Is the cluster just slow Was that the problem You can get all the previous messages by setting auto_offset_reset_earliest_ Let me try it I never want to hear the word kafka after tomorrow this was a nightmare I know rite besmam I thought It wouldnt be this azaaaa migrane neger new benatk Now that I think about it I agree with your proposal to remove kafka from the get text part if it takes a long time Yea even if we used the last produced one we will get the same result every time if anything is not produced Lets remove it from the get text since well have airflow for batch processing the delay wont matter for the output side Yes let me just use text_producers random logic Cloned the repo in my jupyterhub and locally Can I do it locally here Lets have checkin meeting at AM UTC Alright noted you cant have access to the borkers from local just clone the repo in your homeltusernamegt directory Ive done that already and the dags are homeariflowdags folder you can work from there Everybody has permission Just to be clear the dag will have just one task what does the task do Might have more than  task And the main thing is batch processing there All the inputs audios Okay batch process the input to the Kafka broker I think the dags should orchestrate batch processing by calling spark executors The code that takes the input is in the which file please the inputs are not yet generated you can work by creating your own sample file Im talking about the code that implements getting the inputs not the input themselves Id mostly likely be working with it its also not yet written If you are working on airflow you can go to homeairflowdags directory and work in there there is a single dag that executes topic fetching you can see that as example",0.1398891,0.76802754,0.09208342

         now works followed this step  then osenvironJAVA_HOME usrlibjvmjavaopenjdkamd You have to install kafka in the airflow container
Either by adding it as additional requirement
_PIP_ADDITIONAL_REQUIREMENTS _PIP_ADDITIONAL_REQUIREMENTS kafkapython
Or
docker exec to airflow container and install it manually should I run this command _PIP_ADDITIONAL_REQUIREMENTS _PIP_ADDITIONAL_REQUIREMENTS kafkapython _PIP_ADDITIONAL_REQUIREMENTS _PIP_ADDITIONAL_REQUIREMENTS kafkapython
is in the dockercomposeyml file I am assuming you are run airflow using docker Ive found it now _PIP_ADDITIONAL_REQUIREMENTS _PIP_ADDITIONAL_REQUIREMENTS should I add kafkapython Yes try that if it didnt work go with the nd option okay it works UUURA thanks Can anyone help me writing a script to insert data in s bucket I struggled a lot and I think its time to ask for help You can access the S bucket the way you would a regular directory using the path provided how I could connect react with Kafka as producer hahaha j second choice Quantum Computingshushing_face thinking_face
 Definitely UVVGQG how early  or  AM UTC I think the integration part takes time so we should allocate more time to collaborate  Ok sounds good if everybody is here lets have a meeting  AM UTC Yes lets do that So far  persons are available  what about the others  Sorry Im not available for meeting at the moment UVVGQG UUUPMDF what shall we do then May be lets postpone it to  AM UTC I am available the full day so we can do that as well  Im available too Let us have a meeting about the pyspark integration now and then we can have another meeting with everyone later Only the  of us UUUPMDF Yishak is working on pyspark right So we can discuss how to integrate that with the kafka producer 
What do you guys think UUUPMDF yeah the pyspark is a major issue We should talk about it  Lets have the call then now syspathappendospathabspathospathjointexttospeech Can someone show me how to read the audio file which filetype are you working on I dont think the saved audio file has a file extension UUURA what is the saved audios file type It is audiowebm but with no file extension there is a python module called librosa to handle many file types but also there are filetype based packages

ok in that case you can use librosa as
y sr  librosaloadaudio_file_path
it will give you the waveshape and rate based time you can plot it as
pdSeriesyplotfigsize 
                    lw
                    titleRaw Audio Example
                    colorcolor_pal
pltshow  If you want to listen to the audio works in the notebooks you can use IPython package as
import soundfile as sf
data rate  sfreadpath
IPythondisplayAudiodatadata raterate Ill try it thank you UUUPMDF it occurs when there is a filetype mismatch it would be good to work with wav files if you guys could save the audio in that format That was my first try but in the front end I had hard time recording it the only format worked fine was webm thats bad its a program that had to be installed inside the operating system

have you tried this one
import soundfile as sf
data rate  sfreadpath
IPythondisplayAudiodatadata raterate
if this is not working then we will have to install ffmpeg I have never had this error are you working on g_env 
maybe can you dm me the file and I will take a look Ok Ill send you the file path sure UUURA I can read the file in byte format can I send that to the frontend Since I cant access the path yea send the actual file I will download it but it has to be a separate endpoint since you cant send it in json may be send me the filename first with all the text corpus and then I will request with the filename to get the actual file I think we can send it using json its just a string of bytes OK if that works we can do that tooo Ok I will try to read it send me the end point name And is it just me The instance wont connect in G dongle Im using my phones G and it works My phone is G and the other dongle I have demo slack ayseram sweat_smile guys is  g_env working for you You cant activate it its saying
bash activate No such file or directory export PATHoptminicondabinPATH try running this command first it should work its working now after running the above cmd I had to say
conda init bash
then restart the terminal to connect guys  which topic has a produced content gtopicstest try this one gaudioraw still the same May be is it waiting for it to be produced  is it not produced yet I just produced using gaudioraw And gtopicstest has plenty it was the topic we were using to debug UUUPMDF I am getting no such table AudioResponse UUURA yes the table is supposed to be created and populated once the data has been transformed by spark but you can manually create the table and seed it with temp data to test the response here please use the Google Docs link we used for the interim report to compile all the our tasks for the final report submission
 guys I am not able to consume  from the cluster using spark I need a hand here Are you getting an error or is it taking too long a bunch of errors there is no sufficient reference also Can you maybe try to consume the messages using kafka and then pass it to spark Sorry Im not much help I dont know much about spark then the spark will have nothing to do eko
we planned to use spark to consume and transfer the data to the other processor scripts right Me as well smile I know nothing by this time I have tried to follow most of the references but what has worked for them is not working for me What are the errors youre getting What about using spark like dbt to do some transformation on the text data that would have been possible if the data is in tabular form and also If I had been able to consume it from the cluster So its not finding the cluster or the topic earlier I was able to connect with the cluster and been able to get the structure of the topic but the contents werent showing but now after several tries the connection stopped working If you were able to connect to the cluster and if it was taking a long time to get the content thats normal consuming is really slow for some reason but I dont understand why it stopped working now
Did you check the address for the cluster and the name of the topic yes the addresses were unchanged and I have tried two of the topics gtopicstest and gaudioraw Im not sure maybe you can do the other tasks and ask for assistants on the week channel Lets focus on the report and we will tackle all the tasks and issues after that UVVGQG can you tell me how you implemented spark and what exactly its purpose was Its for the final report UUUPMDF at first as we had talked I thought the audio processing will be handled by spark but I found out later its not And also I tried to process the text corpus using spark and it also had a builtin sampling method but you guys said this functionality can be handled by the APIs currently the data fetching is resulting many errors but I will try to fix it till PM EAT if the problem is fixed then we can say we have used spark for stream data fetching from the cluster and storing the fetched data to be processed by the other modules Ok assuming it works spark is going to be scheduled and triggered by airflow right So were using airflow along with spark for batch processing our data yes If it works it will be used to get the stream of data and store it this will be orchestrated by airflow Ok thank you Should we submit the GitHub link as is or should we wait until we finished all the tasks We will continue working after we submit the link I hosted the react part on vercel but it doesnt work I am submitting that too here  link to the deployed front end here It might not work I host it just for submission if you guys want you can include it in your submission Where would we submit the link to the deployed app I just added it along with the github link in classroom Have you already submitted the GitHub link The frontend looks great by the way Yes I already submitted it The commit stamp will be recorded tomorrow so we can submit and keep working Yeah that sounds good Apart from spark what else is left I guess showing the processed audio and corresponding text corpus Once the table has been populated its just a matter of fetch it from the database and sending it to the frontend The code is there were just waiting for the data Yes and I will include some screenshots dockerfile and if I have time I will improve the unittest these are the minor issues There is something about CML in the document but I have no idea what its doing in a data engineering project Yea I am confused about that too Can we have a meeting tomorrow to so everyone can understand the integration of  the different components YES and also  gettimeoutcosted us  hours Lets have the meeting AM UTC at the same time as standup upside_down_face you will be emilien Sure why not This thread just got  replies smile I know smile See you on the standup man So are you going to remove the code we no longer need or should I I am just commenting them out we might get conflict while merging but I will remove them so we can avoid the conflict Alright thank you Well clear things up in the morning see you then Yea bye have a good night here Lets have a meeting at  AM UTC

 interim submission  tuesday th oct at pm utc vs wednesday
 final submission  thursday th oct at pm utc vs saturday Thank you for spoting that Wangui Let me confirm that from the tutors UUUNMRX In answering my question you said if you transported yourself to the past
if I did transport myself to the past I would told everyone how I invented timetravel and all the markets would have crashed smile Updated back to Wednesday and Saturday nice thank you With great power comes great responsibility so use it wisely smile thats true UUDRQH I will keep  that in mind when I timetravel next time laughing Integration of backtesting framework

This is the one of the Wednesday deliverables under the Github link submission

Is this referring to the models Are we supposed to create our own backtesting algorithm or we are going to use one out of the ones provided   or   Create a dynamic scene simple json or ini file that automates the run of backtests by taking in parameters
     Date range start and end date for backtest
     Indicator
     Indicator params range
Does indicator in the above sentence means a variable in the in the dataset Have you gotten an answer for this UUFNPEUX when cloning a repo whats the difference between using gitgitrepolink and gitrepolink when cloning repo can you clarify the first is git the second is html are you referring  vs ssh u mean  vs mailtogitgithubcomgitgithubcom  If so the difference lies in what your asked as credintials the first one requires you to provide your ssh public key And the latter uses your github username and PW I was made a hot seater throughUVAMTFA hackingrolling_on_the_floor_laughing

 Follow the  rule Take a second break from your digital device every  minutes and look at something  feet away 
 Use a humidifier It adds moisture to dry indoor air so your eyes wont dry out as quickly
 Dont stare 
 Keep screens at arms length

  it is still good enough for me rolling_on_the_floor_laughing I dont think people really understand what this man is really talking about myself included obviously
 guys I am planning to present the general overview from my medium blog

is there anyone who is able to show the demo I will show the demo ow thats great You take  minutes and I will do it in  minute sure here hello guys how are you doing
I just wanted to ask how last weeks challenge was for you and if you had any suggestions to improve our performance for this weeks challenge UUURA It was a very good and precise demo Good Job UUUPMDF yeah we should do the planning today and start working from there I think the question of who is working on what task had been the major confusion overall YES that was our major weakness And I suggest we start working today too we have to use every minute we have That is good UUURA and I think we all have to get the same understanding on the tasks given So each of us can have the idea on how we implement those ideas and of course we will have clear understanding on the tasks each of us are working on here so til tomorrow morning lets have a clear understanding of the challenge and lets have a meeting  hour before standup lets share our understanding there and I suggest everybody should come up with the tasks they want to work on and we will talk about that on tomorrows meeting too yes thats a good idea tomorrow morning is good In addition to that I have a suggestion if we have one additional meeting today evening  to share what we have so far and specify the tasks so for tomorrows meeting we all have clear decision on the task we want to work on We can do that but everybody has to be there yeah all of us should be there and todays meeting doesnt need to be that long Yea  minutes max what time should we meet then After the tutorial session here Can everybody join a quick call after the tutorial session We will only have the call if everybody is able to make it sure we can can you put the link here we can use this one
 Sure the meeting is now right Yes if it is started let me in here meeting has started Im sorry I missed the meeting I stepped out To ensure all members presence in meeting can we have fixed meeting time twice a day I understand the am UTC catch up meeting is already fixed I think its best to fix another for later in the day here  AM UTC is fixed meeting time before an hour from the daily standup The later one is not mandatory since everybody might not be able to make it but if we face any major issue we can have those kind of calls Hello everyone well be having our meeting with group  on Thursday after the standup But we are group  Sorry my mistake I meant to say group  Alright Working environment for this week

2022-10-11,"Anyone that wants to can craft and post good questions here in advance of todays careers QampA What are the key things we should consider while choosing our track I want to try a slightly different format  where it isnt a QampA but rather a community discussion I will lead the discussion but the goal is for all of us to feel free to contribute can you maybe invite the  Academy alumni one from each tracks If thats possible What are the chances of applying for two roles like graduating as DE and ML engineer If I select a track can I switch to another track later on in my career What do you think are three most significant parameters when chosing my first job Which track has the highest demand in the job market at the moment Whats ten academy Academy I think  Academy is an organization which works on young Africans to make them job ready and provide them with all the necessary tools and supports to jump start their career on remote jobs globally

If I get your question right If I have interest in one track although I havent met the requirements yet could I pursue it Talk about the availability of these positions in different countries in Kenya Ethiopia Rwanda etc in Africa as a whole and globally Where are most of the opportunities found I think Europe and Africa are the main job destinations for us due to timezone issues I was just pointing out that  Academy does not necessarily  ten academy Ow yeah I got it confused with the website here The QampA session has begun Where is the link  Thanks UUGNNVB I am not sure if I got your answer but can you tell me again why a computer science background is important to pursue the Machine learning track why not math for example from what i remember of the session a computer science background and particularly being able to use javascript frontend frameworks is useful because the interviews for the ml track generally give challenges where youre supposed to be able to create a webpage to present your results so theyre testing ml skill  javascript frameworks via webpage implementation okay so does stremlitredash tablue not enough for this  UPDATE ON WEEK  SCHEDULE

DAI  Dai try pip list UVVGQG pip list works fine still the same so is it for me only May be yea I have tried pip list too no error on my side you can pip install tho right none of the pip cmds are working and UUURA as I see it ipykernel is not installed I think Birtukan is having the error because of that UVVGQG can you try now I have installed packages to fix both errors And How is your vscode working on the notebook I am having really hard time working on that Should we work on our local machines for tasks that dont include airflow and kafka here Does anybody managed to create binance account and download the dataset Are having trouble connecting with the instance I havent tried today but it was working fine yesterday I think its better to work on the instance since we might have an issue setting up and installing packages so we should solve those problems as early as possible Alright sounds good I was able to create an account but when I download a data for a year I get an empty result so this is the other way to Download  use this as reference  I didnt get verified yet my phones cameras sucks for the link I sent you you dont have to sign in OK I will check it out if you find a solid data please do share it here yeah I Was not sure about these resources thats why I hold it back earlier Im very sorrypray that I missed todays meeting I had an emergency can someone give me what kind of decisions you madetask division wise We discussed about the tasks and whats expected on the interim and final submissions and how the different tools would interact with each other and came up with a rough draft of the architecture You can find the flowchart and our task division in the link below
 Thank you very much UUUPMDF Have we decided which dataset we will be using for the eda and backtesting for the interim submission not yet any suggestion The yahoo data if no one has started using the binance data yet I have tried to make sense of the binance data but the date col was in epochs I think I also agree and what type of currency or stock BTC AAPL or what Lets use the yahoo data and pick one of the FAANG stocks I have one question what is the date range for the actual implementationfinal submission   it could not be a specific range I guess since we will deploy a system that allows the user to perform back testing with a specified set of arguments I think well determine that ourselves but Im not certain we have to store the historical data in our db right I think well store the backtest scenes and their results so we will pull the data from ytfinance  but when I ask this same question in the intro to the challenge yabebal explicitly says YES WE HAVE TO STORE THE DATA I dont see anything about storing the historical data in the document so lets ask the tutors Yes I just DMed Yididya Alright let us know his response here please start writing on the document as you are doing your assigned tasks Yes Ill start writing on the document as soon as possible Why cant we use yahoo data Why does it has to be binance UUJNYC so well be using yahoo for the coins too I can see the pip list with some warnings but still have this problem I cant run the code importing backtrader module

 Try working on the jupyter hub til I figure out a way to fix this Okay am I the only one who is facing this error may be from configuration on my sidethinking_face upgradedowngrade your matplotlib to

 No you are not it only works from my side I am not sure why you have to install ipykernel

2022-10-12,"UUGJPC its week   is this a serious question UVHMRPGQ question back to you  what do you expect typical MLEngineers do all day I m sorry I was trying the wrong link The careers assignment seems clear to me  its in the drive  someone had asked yesterday about whats due  please ping with any questions The debate session was well reflected on and seemed to be appreciated  When is the group organizing B vs  Ac team We could get moderators from the alumni In my understanding they build data pipelines and try to teach models to gain predictions or insights from data  but their focus mainly on maintaining models  fine in our experience this may be true at large companies  where there is enough ML complexity to warrant people working fulltime on just the modelling part  Think Google  In our experience you will mostly all start at companies in the  person range where you will do some ML work but a lot more of your work will be working on the interaction with the models Dashboards interfaces tools for users different outputs etc  Most of that will be webdev focussed PS data pipelines  Data Eng Best overview Ive seen yet on how this is implemented in real life  these questions are very useful  please do continue to discuss  ask Yes I get that  so basically computer science background means web development and if I have good experience with that I can proceed with the track right  send me your cv and lets discuss Okay  But its important to understand how all of the tools we use fit into the real world and how they are layered onto each other channel W exercise graded and returned The topic has to be hotsweat_smile Is the interim submission for the career exercise today  I cannot see it in google classroom And now you reminded them UUVHCVKB yes I am the student who reminds the teacher to give us homework sunglasses And I have always been the student who was reason for why the student who reminds the teacher to give homework did not come to school the very next day That not good UUJKJGRAQ joy we deserve a break UUGZJP I dont think this is like school we will not be excused from submitting if the tutors forget smile

 We need somebody to take the advanced EDA
 We need somebody to take the airflow dags
Among the comments logging MLFlow and testing are already done with remaining minor touches

SO WHO IS WILLING TO TAKE THE ABOVE BULLETED TASKS

Comment from the tutors is as follows
 Most members of the group did EDA yet non is completely extensive most are not commented and only Adijat uses markdown Better to have one group member doing the EDA and do it extensively Nonetheless great audio visualizations and explorations
 Theres no setup of CML at all and this was explicitly mentioned in the challenge document
 Was there an issue setting up and using Airflow

Looking to see some improvement with week project
 I can work on the EDA I think Henok and Adijat can take airflow dags Lets also update the whiteboard with details of each of the components we are working on
 UUUPMDF Yes since MLflow has already been implemented are we having the meeting with the other group right now Yes Ill send the link here Group  meeting link

To answer interview questions like Why do we hire you
 Know about the company and understand their business
 Show your learning capabilities concrete examples how you tackle the challenges and provide a solution UVHMRPGQ rejection is a part of the journey Ill advise you to work toward a stronger application package UUGNNVB can offer greater advice on how to handle rejection However I dont think we have reached that stage yet instead lets go gradually toward the job phase yes I will do I am not harry for reaching hiring stage but eager to know what happen thereI will work on building my resume to be more stronger
I have reached a good stage where I can receive rejections before I didnt hear from any of the companies 
Recall the exercise from week   now focusing on your chosen track select  jobs that you believe that you can apply for on  Nov

2022-10-15,"Thank you for the feedback UUGNNVB The interim submission has been returned Looking forward to your final submissions at  UTC UUGNNVB What if you feel like you dont even have half the required skills in any of the three tracks It is especially when you heard about the tools for the first time in this traning and you think youre not good enough to claim that you completely have them In addition you do not have any work experience And youre not from computer science background In that case its really difficult to choose your track and youre not sure if that choose in going to give your first at the required time What do you advice in that case I accidentally unhanded my interim career submission  I was trying to handin the final submission Do I need to resubmit it
My guess is that what I did will have no effect at this point Go ahead and hand in your final submission  I did I just handed in the final submission Still wondering what if I dont have the requisite experience in any field Does that mean that I can not make it to get my first job
UUGNNVB

Knew that experience is important But we always heard from everyone here that not having the background does not matter The mindset is to be ready to learn and to actually do the best to learn Now on the point of getting job it seems like having a software engineering background is required everywhere either ML DE or Web Having interest is not enough and pratical Employers are just looking for demonstration of experience And the matter is that its like its improbable to learn all the requirements in  months if you did not have at least a minimum of experience So how do people with no work experience nor software background will be able to make it Is there any suitable track most suitable to them What does it mean by Complete the skill summary you provide summary for the skills you provided in the table of expertise keywords based on the skills which you highlighted and included Thanks UUURA One person wrote the following in hisher interim submission I dont have any knowledge in JavaScript
programming and some of the required tools and platforms as well for the moment but I believe that I
am capable of deeply learning them during the getting ready period

PLEASE DO NOT PURSUE THIS APPROACH  Our guidance on tracks is based on our experience of what employers are looking for  Its highly unlikely though not impossible that one can fit  years of experience into  months of selflearning Yep But there will be new ones by then Its about getting into the real world of what people are writing Super  One down Get ready for  more It isnt personal it isnt even professional  its just part of the system Train your mind to trust the process It will take months of dedicated effort but we will get there together And yes there will be many rejection emails Rejection emails are a step better than just not hearing anything back I read all the submissions  there are essentially three groups
 Practical and dispassionate approaches to solving the problem of getting a first job  They know that once they get their first job and experience the world will open up to them  These people focus on optimizing for one job and for being ready for getting it in  months
 Confused people who arent sure which way to go  I assume that these people worry about their future instead of focussing on one thing only getting the first job  Id love to chat openly with these people to help them make a good first choice
 Dreamers who hope that because of passion and superhuman effort they will beat the system  Those who aim to doublejump the twin gaps of first globallevel job and getting a job in a field that they dont have the requisite experience for  Most of this group wants to go for an ML Eng role without SWEng experience  To this group I would ask What would you rather be doing this time next year  a globallevel DE job or a local ML job  I feel like those are your two choices                  Hello I am struggling to upload my presentation and report but cant yet What  could be the problem UTEPYRMP Size of file limited UUDBULCL You can check your network Try to close the classroom and try again  UUGYHAUT Watch your dancing video rolling_on_the_floor_laughing  UUGJPC why mejoy joy I just relate that with the musics before the stand up timerolling_on_the_floor_laughing Let me send you another one  wait rolling_on_the_floor_laughing rolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughing I just found it You think its worth reading Wouldnt it bias you Big proof  I think its worth reading man  Is this your new quake book joy For all my Stans out there Do you remember these times

Do have a great week ahead  There is an old Zen saying Before enlightenment chop wood carry water after enlightenment chop wood carry water The enlightened are distinguished from the rest of us not by the work they do but by the _manner in which they do their work_ No matter how much life wisdom a person acquires the chores of daily life remain the same The enlightened however do not do their daily work as a mere means to an end The chopping of the wood is not done for the purpose of building a fire and the carrying of the water is not done for the purpose of cooking food because everything is done in the same state of presence for its own sake without goals

 Set small goals The thought of completing one huge task can seem daunting Having a list of small and achievable goals can help you tackle each one in turn meaning that you make gradual progress towards completion
 Organize your tasks The point above feeds into this one You can stay motivated to accomplish your main goals by creating a precise schedule with dates daily weekly and monthly for when you will achieve each of your smaller goals
  Focus your attention Concentrating on some of the simpler activities you need to complete is another method for overcoming procrastination This is a major confidence booster to achieve set tasks
 Remove distractions They can easily derail your progress whether its having your phone next to you on your desk or having the TV on in the background Ensure you create a comfortable working environment where distractions cant thrive
 Forgive yourself Its easy to punish yourself for putting off tasks You might tell yourself that youre being ineffective or lazy In actuality doing this to yourself doesnt increase productivity it just makes you feel more agitated and nervous So learn to forgive yourself always

because of those problems I couldnt attend most of today session I second you Im really pissed off with my internet connectionIm using the so called LTE but lol i got a speed of Kbs sobmanfacepalming I guess the trip Origin and Trip Destination contained the longitude and latitude of the location right and in that order How could I join the two tables do they have a common attribute that can I use to merge them together You can merge them using pandas   UUURA Do we have a common column that exists in both I think we need a common column to join two tables right Yes we have on the nbcsv we have Trip ID for the driver_location_data we have order_id Those two are similar but for the driver_location data the unique one is order_iddriver_id since the order is broadcasted to multiple drivers UUURA Thanks Latitude comes first in alphabetical order and it also is the first coordinate in a set Longitude is the second coordinate in the set Given a default arrangement so to answer your question no in it is actually in reverse latitude and then longitude more on that here  Thank you Fish   ",0.006080964,0.2641392,0.7297798

 UUJGPC is necessary  to install the package just
 pip install update holidays

dfTrip_Origin_lat  dfTrip Originapplylambda x strxsplit
dfTrip_Origin_lng  dfTrip Originapplylambda x strxsplit UUJGPC thank you so much UUJGPC I dont understand what you said about merging the two tables could you clarify a bit here Super got a lot without doing any form of analysis Really helpful in reframing my hopefully all of our approach to the analysis phase of the data So basically UUGZJP what he said was on the second table you are going to find repeating order ids But when you look at the drivers_actions feature of the repeating order ids you will find only one accepted row even if you have several reject ones UUVHCVKB Thank you What did you understand that perhaps you didnt understand before UUVHCVKB Hello guys I think the trip_id is actually the order_id in the second table right Just want to confirm Yes UUH What I was trying to say was that I understood lots about the data prior to doing any analysis on the data Like the scope of the data what types of things have been kept and which ones are given to us some bit amount of the actual business and what it is that they are really doing and importantly what they want to gain from us in terms of qualitative percentage of order increase and delivery optimizations and about other personal and related types of data they have been collecting and how they were planning on using that for their advantage you are right UUH I guess this will result to a one to many merge yeah Hi I cannot render some graphs on my Github but I can see them on my local notebook is there a fix for this putting it as an image is one option but not a satisfying one I know on the delivery_request data we have lat and lng valuesthat doesnt match to the  location values to the nbcsv dataset when merging on order_id  trip_id so does that mean we also have the driverspilots location in addition to the trip origin location Yes I think drivers location shows where the driver was located at broadcast time or while rejecting or accepting the trip one more questionhow about this case there are many trip_id values in the completed orders data that I cannot find in the delivery_request datahow is that possible I was thinking about how to handle that issue too May be just considering the trips that have driver_action associated with them But am not really sure yet On task  Exercise  of this week challenge we are required to create some relevant features using data that can be obtained in the public domain like rain vs no rain holiday vs notholiday however to do this types of feature additions we need to have time stamps which is not provided how do you think we can deal with this issue UUPVQ How was yesterdays guest talk UUGNNVB That was nice and it provided a lot of domain knowledge I tried this way df_merge  df_nbmergedf_loc how  inner on  Trip ID order_id  but it didnt work for me how does it work for you UUJGRNE this is what worked for me

Are you still here i have some good news before the weekend start are you around no we are working with opening our hear and eye Yes Im still around yes Yes if youll be sharing some drinks Hurry up Emilian we have a submission rolling_on_the_floor_laughing I thought weekend has started for some people You want to join me here Welcome please Hahahahah send tfare my weekends ended when the training started No weekend here congrate congrats for all of you And for you too                     Blog written by  Wang on Mar   described causal inference by taking the following examples Every year  million premature babies die In other words  of all premature babies die _every single year_ Millions of parents have to struggle through the grief suffering and pain of losing their child over a process they cant control Thats a problem Lets say we want to figure out whether comprehensive treatment after the birth of a premature baby will affect its chances for survival In order to solve this problem we need to use causal inference  Study conducted by Jennifer Hill Elizabeth A Stuart in  defines Causal inference as an intellectual discipline that considers the assumptions study designs and estimation strategies that allow researchers to draw causal conclusions based on data                  remember these questions Yes I do  I still face it but this time with more backup plans joyand i some how found a pattern  Im sticking with the trips that have delivery request associated with them cos there i can only do that much with the trips dataset other than find the time it takes to complete the trip and where orders are coming from is all accepted trip delivered or fullfilled is all accepted trip delivered or fullfilled does rejected trip has a relation with fulfillment and unfulfillment of the trip as per my understanding if it is accepted status it is fulfillment of the request and if it is rejected it is unfulfillment of the request so finally we can measure the fulfillment based on the driver actions later in the casual graph and model thanks Isnt it more fun to work with real data than with Titanic data Of course it is which method of iterating through pandas dataframe is less time consuming please trying to calculate distance but it is taking forever from geopy import distance

a
nbcsv contains k orders created in the span of  months from July   December 
driver_locations_during_requestcsv contains driver order requests and the location of the driver during the request for each order in the nbcsv Trip ID Since this is a very data intensive task we calculated it only for one month
driver_locations_during_requestcsvorder_id  nbcsvtrip_id


b
We can easily stipulate for now based on the orders created_at to get a sense of when the drivers got the order for this analysis if we need precise timestamps we will need to recalculate the datasets for the first month again channel Yabebal just joined the session after we ended it and is holding an open floor for discussion on the challenge Join back in if you have questions youd like answered Will it be recorded Power is out herepray Thanks for the update UUPVQ UUGQV unfortunately the session has not been recorded here I was not online on slack and for som of us who did not attend the Yabebals talk today can someone please at least try to summarize the main things he covered sorry to hear that UUJGPC hope its get better Thank you Nat I kinda know where the problem is now I was trying to find the driving distance which required sending an http request to OSRM which is why its taking such a long time to load t_origin_long  dftrip_origin_longtolist

She informed me that she wouldnt be able to finish the assignment until weekend Importantly your CV does most of the talking for you it is your ticket before any interview
We have to keep improving it until it is near perfect

Please be on the look out for detailed review from your assigned tutor UTTKEYCF I have a couple of questions

 Regarding this point
gt  Every level of education should have at least  key courses offered
I suppose these courses have to be relevant to the position if my education is outside CS should I still write a list of courses

 For the submission we were asked to prepare a page CV Is this a strict limit 

ie If we cannot fit all relevant details in  page should we drop some of the details to fit  page or can we have a CV with more pages UUJKJGRAQ
For Q  I would say yes  might not be up to  but I believe for someone like you physics background there should be a few relevant course that correlates and should be highlighted

For Q  If by all means  page isnt enough you can extend to another page Although this is mostly applicable to people with more work experience ie worked in  relevant places  and increased level of education ie MSc PhD so yes You are right maybe I can include some math courses 
Thank you very much channel
Overall comment on  Academy profile

The  Academy profile is almost an extension of your CV no page limit and all anything listed on your cv also makes sense on your profile

 Listed projects should be clickable  direct viewer to your GitHub and include a summary
 Please name your skill areas dont leave it as skill area  skill area  etc
 Video should be included
 Work experience format as mentioned above
 Include cover photo for each listed projects and YouTube video
 You can remove the  words beside about me The th bullet isnt clear for me Why is a youtube video required for the project the th point is not clear to me UTTKEYCF I think what she meant is  you can remove the sentence  words that was written besides About Me in the template for the profile No video is required for the project
I meant a cover photo thumbnail for your video  I understand UTTKEYCF It would be very very better if this list of comments can be located on  place instead of several threads Hmmmn got it  thanks

back in university I used to have a teacher named Kinde which literally translate to My arm and honestly I wasnt that smart to comprehendunderstand the meaning of his namethen the other day I was feeling pain in my arm and used this word in a sentence Kinde then I was like ahhhaaa thats what his name means lol And he teaches about ARM architectures  hahaha yeah man rolling_on_the_floor_laughing he teaches Micro controller and interfacing hahahah what a coincidence UUFNPEUX so punny Fr fr sweat_smilewe were in the same class fyi Just realized grinning True joy joy ere lash and you guys did not know up until now UUFNPEUX  and UUJGPC didnt know what UUVHCVKB It just hit me a perfect ahaa for me whats that UUFNPEUX Kindemy armmy ARM teachersweat_smile rolling_on_the_floor_laughing UUFNPEUX youre killing it man hahahah Well I was born on December  And was amazed to discover its one day before disability day and that was not it Its a day after AIDS day face_with_peeking_eye bro terfeshaljoy Kinde    is there anyone who share yesterdays recorded tutorial                   The official documentation doesnt have a clear step by step explanation  I think this source might be more useful

Is anyone able to complete this tutorial to create and deploy a fully decentralized Dapp in ethereum I was not able to run the code on remix as instructed Hey here please kindly fill out this questionnaire It is a basic questionnaire to collect opinions and some thoughts about the standup sessions As you might remember there were some volunteers that took the task of making a proposal on how to improve the overall interaction and engagement in the standup sessions And your thoughts and opinions will be foundational in the formulation of this proposal Thank you all in advance

 Flutter amp ReactNative templates are uploaded to the Week folder on GDrive To whom can I ask a question regarding the general trainingrelated types of questions such as UTACUUW is the usual first point of contact Thank you Ameliorating the ratio between training and personal working times and by extension increasing the overall outcome of the training so less scheduled time not exactly that is exactly what I want to talk about how to make things better for everyone if possible I am not suggesting anything I just want to talk about it in hopes of making things better for everyone excellent talk to UTACUUW and then lets improve things PS this is the role of each of you as members of our  Ac community Already started discussing on several things excellent    where did you get this just now it showed  years ago when I replied to Emiliens message
then it changed to the normal time when others replied to it Maybe the image you saw of me was actually true and I might be well over  rolling_on_the_floor_laughing remember the picture rolling_on_the_floor_laughing  we are leaving in the future UUVHCVKB hahha yeah yeah I found the picture btw UUGJPC maybe i traveled back in time and replied to the message and got back to the future We have an evidence that UUJGPC is an Alien UUJGPC you possibly could not I kid you not UUVHCVKB i can DM you if you want I think years means the reference time it is  damn that sounds not so far though i mean  years ago is more far than  grin alien stuff I think we should report this for slack engineers Thats not a real issue but they might get it useful but in that case we should be able to regenerate the errorbug cant we send the image I think the issue is because of comparing the view time with reference time It should always compare the release time with the view time what do you mean by reference time UUGJPC we surely have to report hahah  Yes we should UUJGPC I mean have you heard what Nardos has just saidsweat_smile that might be true for slack as well lol I didnt hear that what did she say People are making a lot of millions just by reporting vulnerabilities and issues in a smart contract  rolling_on_the_floor_laughing Bro you never knowjoy I already reported that Bro rolling_on_the_floor_laughing You are still talking with me rolling_on_the_floor_laughing joyjoy Let me just see how can we report for slack I think we can talk them on the live chat really I am taking with someone Let me share the messages oh nice bro you got the motive  I appreciate it They asked me the Url of the messages can I give them i think sowhy not
plus its now showing the correct time have you told them Yes I told them then yeah go on and give them the link maybe lets try to regenerate the bugI will DM you and reply the message and see what happens That would be great Bro common sense boy was I wrong to think it is common amongst us humans

I  was worried about UVAMTFA and UTACUUW told us the reason then I say aha rolling_on_the_floor_laughing We are addicted to CBS and it showsrolling_on_the_floor_laughing I have a joke about HTTP but if I Post it you wouldnt Get itso grin I like geek jokes post it maybe it could  be source of inspiration for someone else I know some more btw  Ill drop them here week by week lol Web dev standup comedy show
every week with UUJGPC Its not me laughing Well im hearing its raining heavily in some part of the capital city Kigali internet and power affected  luckily im out  so UVAMTFA is facing wahala Moral of the story dont mess with Ethiopians Hey guys Am back with new energy I went to see my friends in Ethiopiagrinning being an alien isnt easy guys Tomorrow is another CBS stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes Guess you wont be giving us a hard time now you stood in our shoesjoy Karma is true Hahahah Glad you are back tho bossman Did you just become  an alien to see your alien friend in Ethiopia  All your energy must have drained     more informations about ethereumblockchain        Did this work for you Its telling me no etherium address found to fund UUGYHAUT   Yeah It did work for me                      ultimate guide to data types in Solidity  LogRocket Blog Signal Telegram Discord There are manythinking_face time will answer it Will people stop using those apps though I know I cant Unless the functionality fails If you encounter a bug related to nullsafety when you run the flutter template app use this flag with your fun command point_down
flutter run nosoundnullsafety for the password type anything but the length has to be gt  and you should also select the employee from the drop down to see the next page UVLHPDME Remix has a lot of features that dont function well especially the DGIT feature One I cant sync my changes to git from Dgit on Remix Github settings takes a while to connect to your Github and needs a lot of reloading Would you advise to continue using Remix or swtich to Vscode For those trying out the appinventor has anyone found an extension that works for etherium I honestly havent looked much into it but have checked this 
 here Standup ongoing Please join now Can you let me in Am waiting so am i cam u pleas let me in UVAMTFA let me in please can some one let me in UUURA Solutions to funding account and connecting to git Funding account The twitter sign up is only required for an authorization so after sign in sign up using twitter it will let you to authorize the faucet app so after you authorize it It will automatically redirect you back to the initial funding form connecting to git It is better to use remix as an IDE just an IDE and to play around and test your smart contract so after you are sure your contract is working well you can just copy that to your desired librariesbrownie truffle and Hardhat and compile it there and push to git and also if you want you can deploy it using remix and use the abi and contract ID from there for the frontend part if not you deploy it using one of the frameworks this might be basic question but I am getting only  ETH for fundingdoes that look right But that is enough for the gas fees right sweat_smile I honestly dont know I was late on these steps and I was confused Is that enoughalso after deploying your contract on remix or locally how can you access it from your API also   where can I get the abi file Yea it is enough but you can still use genaache it is much easier and it is local
and for the deploying part after you deploy your contract you will get json filefor truffle it is located in the buildcontracts and you use that on the front end side to connect and create requests abi is located in the json file UUJKJGRAQ On average how much do you think you completed the tasks when you are sitting on Mondays sessions like       or   done Based on individual analysis do you have an infinite loop in your smart contract Do you mean challenges tasks yeah It is still not clear to me since we have standup everyday during the week

Anyway It doesnt matter  I submitted I am having trouble following the current tutorial session will its video be uploaded to the YouTube channel

UTEPYRMP Should it take long I mean how long The request for funding UUURA  Not too long tho mine was max sec Its taking me so long Its been more than  mins what could be wrong Am not really sure if you are not going to deploy it right now you can just use genaache for now  since you can connect metamask with it and also if you are working with remix you can use genaache too Thanks UUURA  This question was explicitly asked for Mondays standup session as written in the last part of the question UUJKJGRAQ you can also edit your responses after you submitted if you want to yes UUJKJGRAQ Thank you I think genaache is running on  can you check that did the session end yes the meeting duration was over I think time out hope back soon can we start a new one maybe It ended due to duration we may rejoin if the host fixed it Join back but ganache is saying its listening on  is the meeting on It ended
 Yeah I just have read that nardos saying rejoin OK mine was on  sorry man I am not really sure whats causing the problem UUJGPC but if this persists use remix with gannache since remix will give a more interactive way yeah yeah I managed to deploy it on remixI just wanted to try it locally and this happened UUKLBR what could be the case for this
 Does truffle use a default network In hardhat you can either specify the network you want to deploy into or its going to be deployed to the default local network I tried bothon the default network its not even connecting
so I uncommented the development network Can you try deploying to another network Actually its deploying successfully rit truffle deploy network development I cant be sureI am guessing its compiling successfully but not deploying it Yes but you need to specify the network configs in the truffles config file Can you add some debug script on the deployment file so that we can see if it has deployed to the network how do I do that Does truffle deploy  cmd deploy all contracts There is no error while running thatbut I see Network Up to date message  I dont see it deploying actually huddle Task Implement the number betting project from  reference and deploy it in a local development network the Ethereum testnet

 UUJGPC 
 UVNLSU 
 UUURA  Does this order look solid to you all It looks solid to me I know UUURA haha UTACUUW Can you please reach him on my behalf too I am planning to present the map visualizations that I presented on Tuesday I had an extra feature I wanted to try out but still havent been able to figure it out If we can map drivers actions on map can we get to see if drivers action is affected by the location Check this reference using orders data  I would propose you go with whats already working  we are not looking into perfection here Okay Alright  calling him soon He is currently busy  But I think within a time allocated   see if its something possible to present and have it ready UVNLSU UUURA OK UTACUUW Olutosin is already on the call link  email             Floating points         didnt they earn B US in a quarter stock price is based on expected future growth but they are still a healthy business  Anyone who has been able to test the casino contract on Remix UUJGPC Did you find the solution  Yeah thanks for checking onI had to write a migration file which actually do the migrationapparently truffle migrate only wouldnt deploy your contract
but I still have one more questionhave you tried connecting your smart contract from a react app Not exactly for the contracts I wrote but for other examples yea I did managed  This is a great doc great let me look at that thanks bruh Can someone let me in to the meeting Guys how to downgrade nodejs use nvm to install a new nodejs and you can switch to any installed node version by npm use npm install g nodeltversiongt 
 This will just downgrade it but use nvm This is a nice resource  how do you handle floating numbers in solidity idt thats possible I think you should try doing that in your front end code Is there anyone here that has faced this error when trying to deploy using solidity It compiles successfully but when I try to deploy this error comes

creation of Refund errored Cannot destructure property result of undefined as it is undefined
 SOLVED 
By clearing the browser cache and reloading remix
Thanks UUURA it is taking for ever to install the app in my phone using flutter run What should I do to install it quickly
Running Gradle task assembleDebug It always takes a while longer for the first installation so just be patient and have stable internet I want to calculate the distance in my smart contract I tried to find work around but i couldnt find one I am afraid it will finish on Sunday after the due date passeddisappointed_relieved rolling_on_the_floor_laughing May be try it after mid night using G it will surely download faster UUURA I will do that UUJGPC UUURA UVNLSU presented to Olutosin and killed it  He was super impressed

channel Kindly find week  schedule in the link below

    A real life company implementing this weeks challenge   Every one 
Me when I was looking for some solution to my error and find it after one day    They are investing heavily into the metaverse their market cap might go down in the shortterm but theyre positioning themselves for the future the market isnt as optimistic Im not too concerned about the market it tends to be more cautious and favors the status quo but tech companies need to be disruptive and forward thinking I dont understand what you mean the market wants to make money and while there are cautious people in the markets there are also a lot of clever people investing one cannot just discount the market signal I think for example is Meta able to respond well to TikTokstyle apps Wallstreet wants a tried and true formula to invest in like Metas ad business but if Meta can demonstrate that the  metaverse is the future and that it can be profitable then the market will change its tune And if there is one thing Meta does well is copy features of its  competitors and come out on top so I think they can beat TikTok maybe but I think you are underestimating the sophistication of the global markets I dont think we can put too much stock into the markets Wisdom after the  market crash a predictable and avoidable disaster I think that we should avoid these generalizations like the market is dumb or people are cautious  there may be examples where that is true but its too much of a generalization to be useful The subprime financial crisis was emblematic of industry wide callousness and ignorance people working in finance either knew about the potential downsides and didnt care or they were completely ignorant Therfore I dont think its a hasty generalization thats my opinion anyways I think you changed the topic I thought we were talking about Metas valuation Yeah my point is we cant always say the market knows best because of the reasons I mentioned above And we shouldnt judge Metas future based on market indicators OK good luck You disagree I said my points above  I believe the market provides a useful signal of future value  It is not always  correct but I think its not wise to completely discount it We live in the world with its systems  I think that as you go into the world the idea that so and so is wrongcorruptirrelevant becomes less useful One must usually work with the world and manage its imperfections But then things will always remain the same I think going against the grain and the status quo is the only way to improve the world Being some what of an idealist is important Were talking about predicting Metas stock price here I dont think were actually talking about improving the world But more in general  going against the grain rarely means jumping off the board of wood and working alone To your point Metas focus on the metaverse might seem unwise right now and might lead to lower valuation but it is going to pan out To quote Metas own motto Move Fast and Break Things But you present no real evidence for your statement There is clear evidence that the metaverse is the future it shows year over year growth and the rate of adoption of VR and AR will accelerate as devices become more capable and affordable Meta will be in the best position to take advantage of that because of their first movers advantage 



 Maybe this can be the topic of the next debate are the sources you are presenting good sources This statement the metaverse is the future is not proven by any means Meta will be in the best position to take advantage of that because of their first movers advantage

Yahoo was into search before Google  Google was into social networks before Facebook  Facebook was into videos before TikTok  Can we really say that first mover advantage is determinant Yes they certainly are good sources and the theme across all of them is the same the metaverse will be the next big tech platform And first movers advantage is often times beneficial and Meta is acquiring almost every competent metaverse startup so theyre already cornering the market Here is another source to corroborate my point about the metaverse being the future 

 gt _NB NOT A MOTIVATIONAL VIDEO THIS IS WISDOM IN ONE MINUTE_
gt _ALSO NOT A CLICKBAIT_
 Wait why is this true Yes they certainly are good sources I feel like you are accumulating maybes and oftens to make a point which isnt borne out as strongly as the data shows But sure perhaps  Im personally not convinced either way but I find the strength of your arguments to be somewhat lacking Did you read the Bloomberg article content  Does it mention that Facebook is poised to seize the opportunity The Bloomberg article is an overview of the metaverse landscape mostly about gaming At this point its a matter of personal opinion to believe whether or not the metaverse is the future but we will see who ends up being right in the coming years Of course we dont know Noone

This is our repo  Hi everyone Have you gone through the challenge document I tried to skim it But we can see that togather tonight So at what time shall we meet are we working on groubs  Yes that is great Almost any time is ok for me Lets wait for the others hello groups is this a group challenge or an individual consider me when you schedule for meeting this night I have oneonone session at  UTC   UTC i think it seems group  but report is individual UUGHTV So what did we decide  here we werent able to create the instances with GPU access We will try to make it ready till midnight or tomorrow morning Okay Yididya Thank you very much for the info Check your email and accept the invitation Thank you for preparing the github organization Look at the tasks I created on the github project and give me a feedback to add more tasks or to remove some tasks For our  tomorrow meeting we all should come up with the design of the project We all should release the design diagram on this channel before we start the meeting What do you mean by design diagram The overall design of the project in one diagram We can put the components of the project Where we start How the pipeline goes the end result Components of the project can include the dataset  the machine learning model the EDA development tools and any other thing So like a flow diagram Yes In my understanding in this project the main and the difficult part is the image segmentation I think we should give our full focus on that It the part that is new to us so I agree we should try to understand it So for tomorrows meeting we should bring a solution for the following problems
 Finding a good method of image segmentation
 What is our expectation from the segmentation output

Semantic Segmentation
Semantic Segmentation is the task of segmenting parts of an image that belong to the same class Semantic Segmentation models make predictions for each pixel and return the probabilities of the classes for each pixel These models are evaluated on Mean Intersection Over Union Mean IoU

Instance Segmentation
Instance Segmentation is the variant of Image Segmentation where every distinct object is segmented instead of one segment per class

Panoptic Segmentation
Panoptic Segmentation is the Image Segmentation task that segments the image both by instance and by class assigning each pixel a different instance of the class  We dont despair of a goal because were not perfect Epictetus said We strive to get closer to it each day We strive to get better each day This as Marcus might have written to himself is your reminder I like this reminder UUVHCVKB   This guy is just insaneeyes grinningface_with_raised_eyebrowface_with_raised_eyebrow

No War at all No war in the world Yeahhhhhhh say it Omnilinguism
to understand every language Whatever you see turns into food LOL and you will solve some addiction problems like lack of that drugrolling_on_the_floor_laughing haha batman is my fav superhero and he has no superpowers but he is super super rich I thought i can ease poverty PEACE PEACE PEACE
NO WAR AT ALL 

SAME WITH UVQN and UUGVFN PEACE or storms powers to control weather and create perfect conditions for farming SDG  may be so no MCU superhero Nooojoyjoy I just want to be as smart what is MCU marvel they destroy an entire city in the name of peace lol Did you say Fishgrinning UUVHCVKB haha Also you need this super power as a community managerrolling_on_the_floor_laughing Gold would be my choice i dont know the superpower for that yes I did idk if i want to feel other peoples emotions like that or the moral obligation to be good Not my word its you UUGQV magnetos already evil let me be evil too grinning yeah cause Jean Grey has more power than magneto Gonna catch my own UUVHCVKB not for everyone joy i hope you live near me when you do Iam agree with u I dont know if there is a super power like that but there is Midas golden that changes everything you touch into gold

 Eish this is what i need now Midas Lol UUJKJGRAQ where is your supersuitjoy the problem with video is internet UVAMTFA the superpower you need to get is unlimited internet everywhere UUHAGTR thats the only thing I am missing UUDBCX eyes For some of us it is not the internet I want to make human multiplanetary Superpower ability to learn super fast  Good luck cathing UUVHCVKB Im not gonna get into that I really dont know about them That one i can solve it without a superpower LOL send you Money for MBS i bet magneto sleeps better at night though UUVHCVKB I will catch you soon waitjoy fairs UUHAGTR Why are you being so honest Hahaha Are you part of the UN cause the research youve done hereraised_hands She is part of the planning team Dont you know that UUHAGTR I wonder too UUHAGTR imagine if we got unlimited internet first then told Emilien eyes Roger that and standing by Loved your idea but  question though will money solve the education part though Lets take USA for instance they have all the money in the world but I think their education system needs improvement UVNLSU sweat_smilesweat_smilesweat_smilesweat_smileits probably cause he has never dismantled a whole human body to atoms UUAKATQ they need UVNLSU  on their planning team UUDBCX I think so too Magneto has accepted his natureJeans powers are out of control though I just listed the  SDGs from googlerolling_on_the_floor_laughing Shes being humble guysrelaxed Maybe UUAKATQ my take is they will have the necessary infrastructure to at least get education be it online homeschooling etc UUHAGTR fr thoughlaughing I just listed them UUAKATQ I think money will solve the education aspect as well because you can name one or two nations whose education is bad despite of  their high budget however you cant name a single country who has a quality education and a bad economydoes that make sense so in my opinion those one or two countries have another factor affecting their education quality perhaps too much liberalism we dont know UUJGPC youre right At one way or another money can contribute for quality education Its just how it used and may be money is not working in favour of all countries But at the end of the day they have a great infrastructure and maybe immigrants are the ones who are actually benefiting from those when they get the opportunity group are you available for a meeting  hr prior to the stand up session  Morning UVVGQG sure Im okay with that an hour before the standup right Morning everyone yes sure Morning Josias Morning everyone please send me your git username in this thread Username JosiasOunsinli Hope youre fine use this meeting link to join AM UTC  username niyotham Hello everyone Username yonamg Yonas the meeting has started  tibarekb youve all been added to the git organization check your emails and accept here is everyone able to connect to the instance Lets make sure that every one can work on the instance I can connect to the instance Great download the data and look at the structure sure I am working on that now have you updated your config file I mean if youre previously in other group not group  you should change gother to g I was in group  did you generate a new ssh key after the previous week No I didnt sshkeygen R

I also realized that Tensorflow is use in industry  while PyTorch is mostly used by researchers  I might be wrong though womanshrugging what was the library used to edit the config file in ssh  remote explorer on vscode its not a library oh could I do that in VS code I was referring to other lib I used lat time Ah Okay Im not sure about that but yes if youre using vscode though if ur on vscode do
code sshconfig thank you all same here Hi as we are trying to find ways to improve stand up session engagement weve prepared a min survey to  get your opinion on the workings of the stand up session 

Please reply done once youve filled the form Let me tell u in the call I was facing same problem login in again struggling to read a smallspecific file from the large zip file Try this
pip install smart_open

import smart_open as so
import zipfile

with soopensbucket_namezipfilezip rb as file_data
  with zipfileZipFilefile_data as z
    with zopentarget_filecsv as zip_file_data  or any other file instead of csv
      list_of_lines  zip_file_datareadlines
       or any other operation here It works now thank you both Im facing the same problem how did it work for you UUJKJGRAQ Close and login again UUDRQH what is the preiview file exactly UVLHPDME UUKLBR point_up So during our group meeting there is a question raised in terms of creatives that we will use for feature extraction we saw that the provided images of the creative are different from each other while some have more than one creative version and during todays morning session Milky said that the creatives will be provided as links so we should do Web scraping to extract creatives in either video or images
At this stage we in group  are concerned about which source we are going to use for our featureextracting tasks 
 The provided data 
 scrape it using  Selenium and build our own data

please can anyone from the tutors of fellow explain more 
UUKLBR UUDBREG UUPVQ same hereraised_back_of_hand I think it would be better to start with the data which is provided on  s I just closed it and tried again after a while and it worked UUDRQH its a hard one This is why some well known companies fire their weakest people when times are good  so that those weaker people have a chance to get another job I dont get it Why does one have to look for another job if heshe already has a job It seems like an unnecessary thing to do

2022-11-02," How we can deal with jobs which state the are interested in juniors or entry level and in the experience section the request  years of relevant work  I have the same question Look into the details of what they are asking you to do in more detail some roles say  years but the work is doable others say  year for similar experiences were dealing with people at companies not just companies they make mistakes or have different ways to look at similar systems i would suggest
If youre within  years of work experience of what they ask for look deeper
Try to figure out this question  are they asking me to design or to maintain  Design roles are unlikely for you guys to fit into  Maintain roles  yes UVHMRPGQ are you starting to apply Noted with thanks 
I started to look at the available roles Just for motivation I applied for some of them for the sake of curiosity And also to know where I am going to search for a job  UUGNNVB  do I need to stop doing that  DAILY STANDUP REMINDERtimer_clock

rolling_on_the_floor_laughing dont take the Judging literally in this context it means you seek closure from the outer world through order planning and organization not you judge people Wow UUVHCVKB then I will stop complaining joy UUVHCVKB So how do people reach you you never make calls LOL Asking wonderful questions Owww Okkkk Telegram on pc is my main mode of communication and above all your lough smirk You are known for your graceful voice I guess Logicians pride themselves on their unique perspectives and vigorous intellect They cant help but puzzle over the mysteries of the universe  which may explain why some of the most influential philosophers and scientists of all time have been Logicians This personality type is fairly rare but with their creativity and inventiveness Logicians arent afraid to stand out from the crowd Thanks You guys are too nice joy Too many peoples crushrelaxed UVAMTFA I think I cannot answer this question  What are you known for at  Academy and why  because I dont really know   I second this Me too grinning Thanks Nio and Amanuel blush I think we should have a session to answer  this question for everyone UUFVHFNF i can tell you what you are known for You guys can ask me i know everyonegrinning UUHAGTR Not far from Movies UVAMTFA Please tell me grinning UUFVHFNF is it far from being the first person to join Standup and enjoy Prestandup Music with megrinning Thank you Emilien now I have something to say grinning definitely the wonderful questionsclap raised_hand_with_fingers_splayedUVAMTFA UVAMTFA Tell me I also want to know But dont say about I cant turn on my video because of the internet issuesjoy UUVHCVKB why did u strongly disagree thinking_face manraisinghand UVAMTFA tell me You got the question wrong The question should be how come some of you guys agree what did u get tho You are missing my whole point brother I did not even do the dn test DONTTELLEMILIEN so how come you strongly disagree for the test u havent took Im not gonna tell UVAMTFA tho zipper_mouth_face rolling_on_the_floor_laughing I think there lies a difference between not taking a test and knot knowing about a test Meeting has started Hello everyone

since UUGJPC is going to work on image scraping we should divide it between us the  UVQN UUGHTV you and I Yea we can so we have to assign it randomly what about that Do we have a meeting for today I think we should and to make it as short as possible Can we meet at  pm EAT That means after  hour and a half can we have a quick huddle just now I have a little headache I need some rest If you want to meet You can do that without me wishing u a speedy recovery nan I hope you get better UUGJPC jump in the huddle and lets split the task  gt UVHMRPGQ

 when the meeting start please mention me Hey guys I see no forks from the repo Dont we need to make forks to submit Or  am I missing something I dont think you need to fork the repo if youre in the organization it shows up on your profile That what we did in group  I think it was the instructions from the tutors I think you only need to fork it if the repo was created in another persons account but if it was created in an organization youre a member of then there is no need Ok  good to know Task assignment is needed to do something for our interim submission This was an interesting discussion blush At some point the discussion seemed kinda philosophical which is more likely to succeed the vision of the few  or the wisdom of the many specially when the many are established institutions with a long history of accumulated knowledge and experience including failed ones Every days begins with expectations and ends with so many experiencesenjoy every moments of your each day and learn most from it  UUDRQH  Im having this error when running the tutorialipynb file Yabebal shared with us today in the week  google folder Does anyone passed this error What did you doinstall to make this error go away

  word thanks UUURA this worked for me how did you detect the logo and logo position without and prior knowledge of the logo oh it is bad dizzy_face sht  my condolences Nooooo I dont think well notice any difference since their service is already terrible My wifi was bugging but it is working now some how exactly UUUPMDF This is like a reminder Imagine how horrible the back up would be Im afraid they might discover that its betterrolling_on_the_floor_laughing face_with_diagonal_mouth it really does happen  Is it only ETC   does Safari use another network  UVAMTFA UUGQV karma is back I bet the Backup is just two copper wires duct taped together UVVGQG thety use the same international gateway Its the second time this happened this year Zget nw man  UTEPYRMP can u pls post todays tutorial Thank u advance Sure  bruh I was struggling so much todayI even called ethio telecom and the customer service told me that I am using Mbs internet rolling_on_the_floor_laughing no sht not only sometimes   hi Mohammed I dont actually know how you do thatI am still searching for waysfrom the given data  we have logo information for  creatives in the asset directory however  of the assets directory dont contain logo information  so it is a must we find a way to locate the logoskeep me posted if you find anything hey UUJGPC appreciate the mentioned numbers The first way I found was to locate the predefine logo from the assets in the image as you mentioned there is more than half of the assets have no logo files 
till now my research say there is no way to do it around but I will reach to you if I found any thing interesting
Thanks for reaching Is that the case that I am having a terrible internet connection today You can use the assets provided for the creative This weeks challenge focuses on computer vision so put more emphasis on that part of the project  feature extraction and automated pipeline building

You can add simple functions that will handle this extended functionality The assets are used to build the whole creative tho so depending on what type of feature you are going to extract you can download the specific creatives from the _performance_datacsv_ files and represent the creative as Milky did in todays tutorial to represent the creative It depends on what type of feature you are trying to extract from the creative and the approach you use as he mentioned That would be the end of software development  Game to guess words according to the similarity between them calculated by an artificial intelligence rolling_on_the_floor_laughing well who knows    UVQN Peace has no alternative Iam happy  who was the teacher from haremaya its time to say happy marriage right UUFVHFNF Is he going to have a marriage UUJGPC haha thanks man UUJGPC UUFVHFNF What did I miss thinking_face UUGJPC Someone asked me in the hot seat if I have a plan to marry and I replied yes I do but its difficult with the war going on Nati is referring to this topic I guess UUGJPC I think I heard him mentioning wedding and the fact that the political situation was kinda barrier for thathotseat Oh Happy Marriage Dont forget us in the cermony UUGJPC Sure I will Haylsh ርሑስ ጋማ yeah clap  were gonna attend a wedding they said during a downturnbad times the company asks people to go to save money the best people leave who is left The average  bad ones I think I got that point What I did not get is  to me it seems like the opposite of what the image is saying hence where the confusion is",0.11796516,0.77349764,0.108537205

 Because Ive chosen to rest on Sundays And they did not want
 Strenghts I can guess what youre going to tell me in advance For instance I knew that youre going to ask if i would be will to relocate before you did ask

 Yes
 I dont know Please hire me
 Hahahahahahahaha please hire me I cant stop laughing Our first interviews be likerolling_on_the_floor_laughing  Nah I prefer working from home sitting  near my kitchen
 Because your office if far from my home I cannot go to the fridge as often as  I want
 my  strength is that I know how to google the answers so fast and weakness is that I rely on google so much
 Nah it is just I use the stack overflow so often Why settle for less ask for the company ownership too  No you come to me
 To get to this job  It left me first I cheated on it with this one  let me open my VPN where do you want me to go
idk they asked me to clean the code and I deleted it  my direct manager asked me to train the model and I took the laptop to the gem rolling_on_the_floor_laughing UVHMRPGQ rolling_on_the_floor_laughing  sorry I am running kernels for detecting edges I might use other edg detecting algorithms and  ctrlc ctrlv The boss guys we will have our meeting in the next  min dont be late we understand Josias hope we will collaborate on the rest of the tasks       Tensorflow  GPU                I think its better to divide the feature extraction tasks like some people on color extraction some on object detection some on text extraction some on logo and some on position channel sure i agree Has anyone gotten through the pyautogui error I am waiting for the solution Hello Guys What else do we need to scrape other than start frame and end frame maybe the landing frame I send you the invitation but it is still pending I scrapped the start frames You can use those images for feature extraction No I was joined through the invitation link Any update UUGJPC Try it now It must work Where are they stored It is in homehenok_desalegndataextracted_images I will be working on the last frame extraction But for the Engagment Rate part this is enough  can you do video extraction UUGJPC Why the video I am taking screenshots after the end of the video The last frame extraction is taking too much of my time so I will do that in the night So I think I should take some other task So who wants some help in the feature extraction I can work on the emotions extraction okay UUGJPC great job so you might help me in logo position detection is it okay  Okay Thats good UUUPMDF go for it  communicate with UVQN How the other features are going Sure UUJKJGRAQ UUGHTV UVQN from my side I searches yesterday for solution to detect logos and I couldnt find any I will be working with you and Natneal to solve I am still working on color and text extraction Have you find anything yet UUJKJGRAQ Find anything like what i do need help as what i am doing arent related can u work on task  number  i will work on  Have you experimented your code and found any output Like any color Yess Because the code is almost provided Now I am just trying to apply it to data in mass To produce a csv file of the results we have now a mass data  Try on that I am on it Fixed UUGJPC relieved here can we have a meeting  When now before the next session so that meeting doesnt go long and we could catch with our tasks Im available UUJKJGRAQ
UUGJPC
UUGHTV
UVQN what about you guys  I am available too  I strongly suggest to meet now so that we could have more time latter I cannot right now  no worries I think we all should meet tonight So is the meeting now yea We need Tigisty and Emitnan too join us now to decied Hello Guys Sorry I was out of network Hey Tigisty How is it going So UUUPMDF you can start on the emotion recognition note that to use best performing algorithm Yeah Im using DeepFace for the emotion extraction Its good just am working locally have problem with my instance vs code Nice How is your progress I need locally downloaded data or at the end I need someone to run my script at the instance Just testing using single data should I  detect objects from video or image dataset would be better if it can handle both  What is its performance over the other Hope better Its pretty good
 here please use this command to activate our environment
source homegedion_abebeweek_envbinactivate hi guys how do I run a code python on  pic wo taking hours

so far I was running the code on small batch of pics just realized it will take around  hour to run the whole dataset sweat Can you confirm which directory I should use to store the output csv files good one  channel please join the standup  Please let me joinpray m UTACUUW channel Due to cost the aws instances starting from today will be stopped at UTC and start at UTC Take note of the schedule when you are working this week UVAMTFA Youre in let me in pls UVAMTFA Hello channel I am kindly requesting you to send me your formal picture Passport photo most preferable We will use this for Graduation preparation

sudo aptget install pythondev
try to install first  I tried this but still having the same error how about export DISPLAY then import the same error XliberrorDisplayConnectionError Cant connect to display  Errno  Connection refused UUKLBR help us please I think the problem is that the package do not work on aws instance it is not for remote machine guys you can run the codes in the instance in a way that will allow your local device screen to be used by the remote instance but I dont think its a good solution If you really want that you can use the following code as you run ssh cmd
ssh o ForwardXyes o ForwardAgentyes o ForwardXTrustedyes g replace g with your group i tried that and wasnt solved It even got me somehow banned UUFNPEUX I was able to import the modules and all using the above code its the chromedriver thats giving me a headache on the instance right UVVGQG yes As far as I tried to understand abou this problem DISPLAY refers to something like a port or something that pyauttogui can hook to then by setting DISPLAY returns an error likke  Connection  Refused which I can think of the remote machine is blocking some of its ports  I might also be compleetelu  wrong guys but lets dicuss  UUKLBR UUDBREG UVLHPDME actually the display problem can be solved by adding the following
   ForwardX yes
   ForwardAgent yes
   ForwardXTrusted yes
in the ssh config file or just by passing these as an arguments when we connect to the instance using ssh the problem with this approach is that it requires a local pc display to work on which means as we pass the above arguments we are just telling the instance to use our local display which is sort of a resource intensive task  for chrome drive Anyone with this error when runing  pip command

Please Join Now hey how other teams is doing with logo position feature extraction  What do you mean saw fish UUFNPEUX but the file is physically present im using kerasutilsimage_dataset_from_directory may be can you send screenshot of your folder structure  how do you iterate through the images I was trying to use glob but not successful import os

you can now access all the filesimages inside that particular game_id Thank you Natiprayskintone I am not sure how successful it will be

The main issue we are facing regarding detecting logos is _how can a model detect any logo that it is not trained on_ Right So instead of trying to train logo images what if we train our model on various logo shapes outline then try to extractdetect that shape from any image we can use object detection here  If you think about it most logos are quite similar in their shapes  please let me know if anyone has tried this I meant the folder structure where your code is located is it inside notebooks folder yes I am not really sure what seems to be the problem here may be try with an absolute path  okay btw its the load_img function generating this error It worked in other cells Its specifically refusing here where is load_img function located in the same notebook i wanted to read an images from a list containing paths It didnt load any of the images right I mean like load_img is not working for every file im not so sure im just appending it to a list but it loaded some because this specific image is not in the beginning of the paths btw the machine is down ryt Yea it was down since midnight an hour after midnytsmirk Thank you UUURA I wish I had provided more help but you are welcome anyways ",0.0063901595,0.6137707,0.37983918

    it is live  you can attend it 

FOR THOSE WHO CHOOSE THE DE STREAM  This answers a lot of questions about handling complex data in a basic way
  
   here join the QA session with Milky  Im guessing the next step is to create a pipeline that can go through all the urls and extract them Im not sure yea i am also managed it on local machine sure i think so we must build the pipeline for all assets to extract each feature Help me understand

 You solved the problem of the Key error DISPLAY  error But locally and not on the instance
 And you run the code and manged to extract features
 Do you mange to extract the features of  file or every file inside  asset folder
UVNLSU UUEJR UUVHCVKB I didnt get the key error Display error
Its just the extracting start frame and end frame and preview video from web I havent extracted any feature yet UUVHCVKB correct me if i misunderstood the task You got it you did not misunderstood anything Rather its  me who misunderstood  question Hi UUVHCVKB the pyautogui is works on the local machine not the instances I tried to extract feature from the single image not from assets folder What feature are you trying to extract i am not sure but i think color and text channel we need someone who takes the extracted features and do some basic EDA and preparation for the ml task Guys is there who did select whole asset and generete features and save file Question what feature and parameters are to be used for the ML Should we have a meeting sometime i think it is better That sounds good I managed to extract color and save it what feature are you exactly talking about sorry for the late reply I just logged in great how you did iterate or how u did fish UUEJR  and UUHBCXDY can we schedule this today yes we can why not  jittarget_backendcuda

sudo apt install tesseractocr
sudo apt install libtesseractdev I can do that Thanks Done Nice how did you do that Magic rolling_on_the_floor_laughing Opencv template matching Hey as long as it works Im good with it UUKLBR I need help please But the blocker right here is the logos must be cropped well But I think we can just extract if the logo is available or not and the logo start position We only need the position so I think a rough estimation will be fine Nice So we are done with that Can you provide the steps you followed And make sure that you are in the same environment I was trying to use opencv to check whether or not a start frame had a face in it before doing emotion extract to save time but the face detection is NOT  accurate This is exact when the logo is in png and the background is transparent We can tell the exact location But does the image has faces import argparse

cvwaitKey You can use this code Mohhamed What I meant to say was it is NOT  accurate sometimes if the face isnt clearly visible it wont recognize it So should I just do emotion extraction on all the start frames How much is the accuracy In your predictio UUGJPC conda installed in the instance Can I access it Gedion created pip environment so You can use that Not sure cant say but if we use face detection first it will save us a lot of time since we wont have to run emotion detection on start frames that dont have faces in them use this command to activate the environment source homegedion_abebeweek_envbinactivate Use the face detection if the face isnt clear it is also difficult to extract emotions from that Ok tnx Good point Ill do that Are there any empty start frames May be Why did you say that guys Can you post your experiment outputs It would be good if it is a csv output Catch the exceptions The start frame is detected automatically so it might happen If exceptions happen just pass to the next image we will find a way to clean that later I have an idea What if I detect the edges of the frames and count the pixels It might tell me how crowded the image with objects Ok What do you think of the above idea guys Thats a nice feature to extract but what is the difference with counting the number of objects The Yolo isnt trained in all objects So it might not detect some objects I dont think it detects jebena rolling_on_the_floor_laughing I didnt realize the jebena ad business was boomingsmile It is We have so many lovers of cofee I am the one Installation needed here pip install tensorflow pip install keras numpy pillow scipy hpy matplotlib opencvpython kerasresnet pip install imageai upgrade Tensorflow is already installed UUGJPC Check pip list No tensor flow is visible to me Version I need tensorflow  for imageai It meet compatible To avoid version conflict maybe you can create a new environment How many extracted images do we have we have around  files After doing the face detection and emotion extraction I got around  results Most of them might not have faces Oh ok I thought the the code didnt detect most of them but if most dont have faces then I guess its fine Yah It is in your csv put the those gameids And tell that doesnt have faces Im going to put None when there is no face detected Nice raised_hands Is there anyone who has difficulties in repo cloning Guys Lets be selective on the features So tell us your progress UUGHTV UVQN UUJKJGRAQ UVHMRPGQ UUUPMDF UUGJPC did you installed the packages Which packages Listed out above UUGJPC Done Ok let me try I extracted the dominant colors  most dominant with thier percentages from start frames It is in a csv file in homeemtinan_salaheldinextracted_featuresstart_frame_dom_colorscsv Im almost done with the emotion extraction I just need to create a csv file Then Ill get started on the object detection After finishing extracting text I will try extracting other color features  if you have any suggestions please tell me What are the dom_prct_ and dom_prct_ cols It is the percentage the number of pixels which have color_ divided by total number of pixels This is nice Jegna You will make it for the endframe too Sure I can run the same code 
Do we have end frames 
Or do you mean looking in the provided dataset We have  scraped endframe dataset Let me finish all of thet and I will send you Or  might be enough for this project Who is good in making streamlit dashboard I put the  end frame images in the extract_images folder working on this project looks like I enter elementary school from the kindergarten
now I am solving my code error without crying in the slack channels
yaayyyee when I imported my notebook to jupyter it said pandas module not existed ow to solve that  pip install pandas I tried that but also giving me the same error Are you using the env do conda install pandas maybe yes Use the week_env environment Iam using  it UUUPMDF the problem is solved with conda install thank you how  I access the assets data from jupyter  UUJKJGRAQ UUUPMDF homehenok_desalegndataChallenge_DataAssets
 UUUPMDF Yes Hello guys We should meet tonight and update each other What time May be after  hour Sure At  EAT We should discuss about the our progress and the to do tasks Are we having a meeting now Yes we do  UVQN UUGHTV homegedion_abebeac_weekcomputervisionforcreativeoptimisationdataemotions_extracted_datacsv homegedion_abebeac_weekcomputervisionforcreativeoptimisationdataemotions_extracted_datacsv
homegedion_abebeac_weekcomputervisionforcreativeoptimisationdataobject_count_datacsv You will find the feature that I extracted are in the directory

homeemtinan_salaheldinextracted_features I collected all the extracted feature from UUJKJGRAQ and UUUPMDF could I import open cv without installing it  No you couldnt But Gedion might installed it in the environment I activiate the environment inside the jupyter put the same issue happen Install it though i cant  not through conda or pip isnt pip working for you it was working So what happend now idk I tried to install it fron VS code terminal and it is installed with pip but I cant import it to jupyter Are they in the same environment jupyter and the instance  Make sure you are using the right kernel for the notebook in the upper right corner 
I made this mistake before i did found ir but how is that will affect the work can you explain because I have never come to this problem before I think it changing the kernelenv changes the path jupyter is using to look for modules Just the same way as changing env in the terminal It might not be ur issue okay  I see
i changed it but nothing happen I dont know what this means  sorry I am trying to install opencv via conda but it didnt worked Can you activate Gedions environmnt and work on that He created a python env using pip I could activate it in VS terminal but I am not sure about jupyter  are the instance working Yes perfectoo UUGJPC one blocker down let me do the other  Keep learning and growing my bro I have no idea bro it kept dying she doent lnow that I am ASLO it looks like the problem with the instance What is ASLO also dying instance works fine seems the problem with cvimshow module yes it is  Add cvwaitKey 

cvdestroyAllWindows I aded that and it didnt work This is nice How did you do that magic hahahhahah I can see what we want to store  game_id startX startY templateshape templateshape great I though of copy all the logos to our extracted file what do you think  We can do that But at the end of the day we want the csv file yes So do both of that I already wrote the code of copy but it need permission to be executed person with Sudo access So can I can run that Tell me how to run that Has anyone connected with the instance this morning You can store it in your folder Alright I got connection timed out Have you connected Same here I dont think they have started the instances yet You are probably right The ultimate form of preparation is not planning for a specific scenario but a mindset that can handle uncertainty Its not the load that breaks you down its the way you carry it are the instances down or it is just from my side UUGQV ke lelitu  seat eske tewatu  seat the instances will be down in Addis Ababa time wait is it going to be like that everyday or was it for yesterday only Everyday since yesterday There was an announcement yesterday about this I think you missed it Since most logo shapes are similar building a custom model with good training sets would do the job Getting a good set of images for training might take time So its best to find some pretrained models that would extract logo And we are not even sure that the position of the logos are correlated with the outcome You can work on the the other given relevant features and see how they are related and work on the logo extraction if you have time Or one member of the group can be assigned to focus on that task while the others work on extracting other features and building the model timer_clockREMINDERtimer_clock REMINDER timer_clock here

 UTXVNH I cant connect to the aws instance all of a sudden I keep getting connection timed out though it is working well for other team members  I think its only for me It works from ubunuts native terminal right The  problem you are facing is from vs code right no it connects neither from vscode nor from the terminal That is something else thought it was only from VS code Here too Is it our group Yea Group instance is down We will get up in a few minutes Should work now yes its working thank you here GUEST TALK IS ON Please join Its failing again UUDBREG kex_exchange_identification read Connection reset by peer
Connection reset by  port  When we extract the text from first frame or the engagement screen part of that text is the engagement instructions 
Is there a way to identify this part and get its position Any hint will be appropriated blush Since the engagement instruction is a png why dont you just locate that image on the main one And take that as the text location

UUGQV UUJVFZ who was on object detection I was on it but was not successful what do you need I could not download the library torch I tried it with different environments on my local machine but it keeps failing why dont you work on the instance torch is over  MB adel it is kinda aza to download it locally Yeah I tried on the instance first and I got this
 what is this I can not see it you need to install ipykernel do pip install ipykernel Ok thanks let me try i already installed it now try it now guys is there p reprocessed data if where i can get i want to try deep_learning model i dont think we have enough preprocessed data for deep learning Even CSV data where i can get inside the observations folder ok Guys can we have quick meeting may be today or tomorrow channel dont forget final submission guys Im finishing up the model too submit the org repo if you submit now Good job bro but dont forget to submit your report Hello Guys I merged the data I am waiting for the rest of the features to be merged Hello Guys here hello everyone let us use the Google Doc link below to summarize what each of us have been working on so we can compile it for our reports

اللهم امين ربنا يحفظ امهتنا You can see the result is on the notebook If we discuss that on a gmeet call before  mins of standup that would be great I think we should prepare on the tasks we worked on so we can present our works I am doing that right now Nice You all should give me points you want to talk about and I will make the slides So lets come up with our points and compile for tomorrow presentation Why not now I am making the slides what do you think  Did you use opencv template matching right Also to mention in the challenge point how Amazon the giant company faced logo detection in their work yes Nice I will make that I modified the design diagram a little bit I want everyone to state the challenges heshe faced clearly and to make it look as difficult as it could then to cure their disappointment with a solution we did to overcome it By that the listener will be impressed with the result and would notice the amount of effort and mentality we put on the problem solving I agree with that I saw that but a I need more explanationlike are the scores mean square error good or promising Or is it very clear that we need more features Gedion will explain that to you Actually the accuracy isnt good We should modify that for the future My point 
 tools and algorithms we were used to implement their advantages over the other algorithms
 Modelling  performance and  feature importance  why the model  Feature extraction and image segmentation  why how  Challenges We will talk just talk what we worked UVQN We wont explain the concepts So You can talk about the object detection and the method you followed to do that And you can talk about the challanges you faced Oh great  So we will all present Yes yes we are It will be amazing if we present all of us according to the project work flow  the one who works on web scraping feature extraction  modeling Okay I am making the slides like that Thanks UUGJPC are you making slides for your portion alone or the whole work I am making the whole slides I think some of us worked on more than one step it is better if we choose the order right now Ok Then share and let we add sth if someone want some modification on hisher portion I just put the title images and some points So You should prepare what you are going to say Notice Please make your speech lt  minute Can you give us an editable format  Is the link working UUJKJGRAQ Yes  thank you very much I always listen to this stroy like its my first time

UUUPMDF
UUGHTV
UUJKJGRAQ I think I cannot present since UUGHTV said he took the logo and cta I think Mohamed should present the logo and CTA Henok You should skip this presentation Challenges 
  Logo detection and button positioning was the most challenging part and the fact that its also global issue companies like Amazon faced the same issue and they invested on teams andbuilt huge  infrastructure for over coming this problem
 The challeng was all the available solutions work as API and we cant risk our sensitive data to be sent to third parties also the available models need to be trained on large amount of data to solve the issue besided it will cost time and money to do that 
Proposed solution
 We used a creative way that maixmize the quality of results while minimizing the cost 
 We used template matching method wich is available in OpenCv library
 We gave the model a picture of the logo and aske it to locae its position on the image
 We extracted the Starting coordination  points of the logo in the image plus the hight and the width of it
 The result was more than  of the logo positions was detected and more than  of engagement buttons was detecte also
Future recommendations 
 Train our own model to get accurate results
 We should use Yolo  as a model 
 UUGHTV those are my points UVHMRPGQ ur presenting So Ill present the object count emotion extraction and the ML model no worries UUGHTV
last last list UUGJPC
UUUPMDF
UUJKJGRAQ

Orisos Swett Marden Good view  Author Rebecca Solnit on growing whole rather than growing up

Growing up we say as though we were trees as though altitude was all that there was to be gained but so much of the process is growing whole as the fragments are gathered the patterns found Human infants are born with craniums made up of four plates that have not yet knit together into a solid dome so that their heads can compress to fit through the birth canal so that the brain within can then expand The seams of these plates are intricate like fingers interlaced like the meander of arctic rivers across the tundra

The skull quadruples in size in the first few years and if the bones knit together too soon they restrict the growth of the brain and if they dont knit at all the brain remains unprotected Open enough to grow and closed enough to hold together is what life must also be We collage ourselves into being finding the pieces of a worldview and people to love and reasons to live and then integrate them into a whole a life consistent with its beliefs and desires at least if were lucky You African telecomms data All right thanks Hello channel here we are with the last contest of the training Todays contest will be a bit longer and more challenging  focused on problemsolving skills and thinking out of the box

The challenge starts at  UTC and ends at  UTC giving enough time for those that have mock interviews We expect everyone to use python amp SQL resources that have been shared until now

Here are some essential SQL resources that will help to advance SQL skills

  subquries
  manipulation functions
  common Table Expressions
  Stored Procedures
  defined functionsUDF in bigquery
  window functions
  efficient SQL queries
We recommend everyone to test their problem solvingskills on todays contest and focus on those areas throughout the job search phase Challenge link  Thats sad man I know hes trying to say it never too late but it kinda is tho In this conversation my understanding is UUFNPEUX is an old man and UUDRQH is afraid of ages rolling_on_the_floor_laughing rolling_on_the_floor_laughinghahaha UUGJPC thats literally by biggest fear not being able to realize my potential  as early as possible imagine marrying at the age of  and having a baby u look like a grandpa for your own child Who is going to marry you at  You will even be a father for her rolling_on_the_floor_laughing you guys should workoutsmiley  is the time for edir wearing gabi sleeping on the sofa while watching tv watching esat channel  and so on rolling_on_the_floor_laughing UUFNPEUX I do so you wont be as old at  UUGJPC if you got the moneybag u can be a sugar dad joy Someone from B said
